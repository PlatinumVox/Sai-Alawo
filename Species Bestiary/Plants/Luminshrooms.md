**Luminshrooms** are tall, chemoautotrophic fungi that glow in a variety of colors, depending on what pigments they produce. Luminshrooms grow to be 5 m tall, with caps that are 2 m tall and 3 m in diameter. Their stems are 1-2 m in diameter. Luminshroom spores even glow and covering oneself with them is a good way to make sure you have enough light to explore the dark of inner ruins. When Luminshrooms die, they release nutrients right back into the soil, which encourages the growth of more Luminshrooms, and when spores from one mushroom touches another, spores for sexual reproduction are produced, and when those spores land, they begin growing. However, putting the spores on a solid surface, such as a rock or soil will allow for asexual reproduction.
