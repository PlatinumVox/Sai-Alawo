This shuddering, booming jumble of structures
moves itself by deforming, rolling, and
sometimes extruding metallic legs or wheels.
A rabid fabricator is the size of a house and
always voracious for more input material, be
it synth, metal, or flesh. Buzzing, smoking,
emitting chemical odors, and leaking shafts of sun-bright light, a rabid fabricator is not subtle.
Rabid fabricators are thankfully rare, but they can be instigated during a crafting mishap by
those who attempt to steal the fire of creativity from the prior worlds but get it wrong and burn
themselves. These automaton-like creatures can improve themselves over time if they get hold
of the right plans, allowing them to further enhance their already frightening ability to extrude
manipulators, cables, and blades of all shapes and sizes.
