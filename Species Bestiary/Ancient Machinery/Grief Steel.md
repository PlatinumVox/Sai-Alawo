Whether encountered in the deeps of a lonely ruin or wandering across the empty landscape, the sorrow-wracked griefsteel is an automaton that is unlikely to ever find solace. Crafted to serve as a companion to someone who died aeons before, these shambling mechs are forever
heartbroken. Though they are self-aware automatons that are able to learn, some still get stuck in a mental loop from which they’re unable to escape.

Unending sorrow makes them unpredictable. They’re not usually a threat, but they’re also not usually helpful. They’re too lost in their own misery to notice or care about others’ needs.

Sometimes, an anguished automaton strikes out in fury over their loss, and explorers who’ve disrupted their iterative depressive cycle make good targets—especially those who remind
griefsteels of what they’ve lost.

**Taste:** Metallic and Inedible, Although some sringly pseudo-flesh can be found within its shell
