**Peak Squid:** A carnivorous cephalopod, the Peak Squid uses hydrostatic pressure to maintain an upright posture and can even squeeze through tiny gaps by collapsing its hydroskeleton. It lives on mountains and in caves, and the hydroskeleton lets it quickly regenerate from wounds, protect from shock, easily transport nutrients, waste products, and gases, and provide enough pressure to walk upright. This also lets the Peak Squid squeeze its prey with its tentacles, and pull them into its hard beak, where it crushes hard tissue and tears soft tissue. Peak Squids are usually found near bodies of liquid water, where they can get more of it. However, Peak Squidsâ€™ bodies become rigid if frozen solid, but for their climate, their blue blood contains an antifreeze.
