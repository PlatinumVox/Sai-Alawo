Lancetraps are insects that burrow into holes in rocky terrain. They are named due to their proboscis, which has a hardness akin to diamond, and can be extended in all its 3-meter glory in a fraction of a second. They do this as soon as prey passes in range, and the Lancetrap’s proboscis impales them, before extending many barbs to dig into their flesh, preventing it from being removed (assuming that they’re still alive). Then, the barbs are used to drain away the bodily fluids of the victim, before being retracted and the dried, shriveled corpse is let go. The bloated Lancetrap then rests, knowing that it’s had its fill for now. While searching for mates, as well as laying eggs and raising larvae, Lancetraps are known to actively hunt down and skewer prey and feed it to larvae.
