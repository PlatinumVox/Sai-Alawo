**Glacecrawler:** Glacecrawlers are creatures that feed on the Lungmelons. They move by pulling themselves across the ground with their arms that end in claws, and have smooth, hard underbellies for resisting the friction. Their mandibles connect to the Lungmelons, and begin drinking out the gas-rich juice, using their mandibles. Glacecrawlers store extra gas in their bodies and can release a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor from their pores that rapidly cools potential predators, killing tissue. Glacecrawlersâ€™ blubbery bodies protects them from the severe cold of the icy [[White Gum Wastes]] they call home. Some have even observed Glacecrawlers sucking other plants that have managed to grow in Alawo tundras dry, and even whatever animal was unfortunate enough to be caught in their mandibles.
