Vilera are strange and dangerous beasts with no defined evolutionary origin. Forged mostly of nanites forged from a core that serves as their "heart", they are able to reshape themselves into the appearance of people that they have seen before, as well as being able to mimic sounds that they have heard. Worse yet, they appear to have at least a near-posthuman level of intelligence, with those who have lived around other people or obtained access to literature possessing the ability to speak by stringing the sounds they imitate together. For reasons unknown, they feed on the blood of posthumans, with some preferring to drain their prey in a single session, while others will leave they alive, to perhaps feed them again later. Worse yet, their abilities with sound often allow Vilera with access to artifacts to utilize a variety of Resonant abilities in their hunts. Vilera can only be killed by shattering the core, which renders the nanites inert. It is uncertain by what manner these creatures come into being, as they make no evolutionary sense, and have no known means of reproduction.
