**Motefly:** Moteflies are closer to bees than fireflies, in the fact that they form hives. These social insects feed on Moteshrooms, gathering spores to make into a glowing honey. Moteflies will sometimes drop the spores, causing new Luminshrooms to grow. Motefly honey is known for its savory taste, as well as creating a glowing outline of the digestive tract of whomever eats it, which can have its medical uses. Another thing is that if a Motefly stings you, it will inject a toxin that will cause one severe itching, as well as glowing blood. Glowing blood may sound harmless in of itself, but there will be no way you can hide in the dark. Wan-Martens love this kind of easy prey.
