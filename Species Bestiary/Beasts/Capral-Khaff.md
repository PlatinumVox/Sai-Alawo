The Khaff is a llama-goat like animal, about 4-5 Feet tall, with big, wooly hair. They are kept, bred and used in central mountain regions of Alawo for their fur, Milk and Meat, and are a common animal in the cities of [[Dahani Triumvirate]].

Traders also use them to transport goods trough rough and harsh terrains that have less oxygen, like Mountains.

The common folk love eating cheese made from their Milk, and their Meat. It's Meat is expensive and in certain cultures, but it's Milk can be found all around, and probably in almost every Nephilim household.

**Don't Eat the Khaff**

The Nephilim don't eat much meat, but when they do, they generally eat either chicken or game, but never Khaff s. Eating [[Capral-Khaff]]  is so frowned upon that they even have an idiom "to eat the Khaff" that means to do something you really don't want to do out of desperation or after all other options have failed. (Khaff s are taboo for a similar reason dogs are taboo in many irl societies).

In substitution of meat and proteins, species of moths, butterflies, crickets and beetles are eaten, although they're less popular than other food groups. They're eaten whole.
