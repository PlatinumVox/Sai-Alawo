![[1naqk2snali81.png]]Wild Desuri are known to be quite peaceful around other prey animals, and often form herds with other herbivores. While initially they can be a little mistrusting of people, they're not aggressive and typically will just avoid them. During the mating season, however, it's best to stay away if you don't wish to be gored.

The Desuri have large nose-pointed horns which are used  non-combat uses, most notably cutting down thorny plants which have evolved defences for their fruits and energy root galls! They're curved away from the nose to prevent getting caught on things when digging for these root galls.

It looks like a mix of a zebra with a rhino horn. Zebras are one of the best camouflages in the animal kingdom of our world and rhinos have a shark horn for self defense when charging. So the Desuri must be a very difficult animal to kill and let alone domesticate. So in Alawo's economy they are very prized steeds for transport that isnt through [[Steam Trains]], [[Rickshaw]]s, or [[Dirigible]]s. They might even be a display of wealth when owning one.
