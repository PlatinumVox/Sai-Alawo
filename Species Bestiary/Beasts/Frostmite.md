A large parasite usually found in cold places. They sweep the cold barren lands in search of corpses buried in the snow. They eat the preserved flesh and leaving a ravaged skeleton in its place, devoid of their former identity.

Often they can be found within lung melons as hives for protection from the harsh winds. They often can be seen swarming a Glacewalker as they try to bite into a fresh Lung Melons
