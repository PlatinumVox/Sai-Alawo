This creature got a base of capybara with some bear anatomy and cute pig ears thrown in. It’s designed to be a rural beast of burden. It’s about boar sized and very strong for its size. It’s also very adaptive to the difficult terrain of the land with lots of waterlogged ground, swamps and dense foliage. You just gotta make sure the load it carries is water proof.
