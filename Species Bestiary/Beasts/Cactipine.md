In an effort to make deserts more viable for colonization, scientists introduced a variety of genetically modified creatures that are made to survive the melting heat and provide food to those who wished to live in such harsh conditions. One such creature is the Cactipine. Despite its name, it is actually a giant rat infused with the DNA of a cactus. It resulted in the specimen gaining sharp medicinal quills, hardened green skin, and a funny tasting "meat" that confused vegetarians and carnivores alike.
