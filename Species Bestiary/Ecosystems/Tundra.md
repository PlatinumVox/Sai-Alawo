### Gum Tundra

The Gum tundra is a frosty, unlivable, treeless territory of low, swampy fields in the north and south of the world. The ground of the Gum tundra has forever solidified subsoil, called permafrost, which makes it hard for trees to develop. Many fossils have been found in the permafrost that is located in these biomes.

The **Lungmelon** is a spherical fruit with a radius of .3 m, and a mass of 28 kg. What makes it so unique is its ability to store gases, which lets it survive at high altitudes, where getting not enough carbon dioxide for photosynthesis is a real concern. Due to the Lungmelon’s gas absorption, it can increase in mass to 38 kg, becoming significantly denser, and that gas can be harvested for breathing purposes. Putting a Lungmelon over one’s head should give a person enough oxygen to last a good, long time. Its fruity interior is moist and full of nutrients, and in case of an emergency, the Lungmelon can make a good weapon, especially when filled up with gases. The seeds will grow into new Lungmelons, given enough time.
