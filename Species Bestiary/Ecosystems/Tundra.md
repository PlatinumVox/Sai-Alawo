### Gum Tundra

TheÂ Gum tundra is a frosty, unlivable, treeless territory of low, swampy fields in the north and south of the world. The ground of the Gum tundra has forever solidified subsoil, called permafrost, which makes it hard for trees to develop. Many fossils have been found in the permafrost that is located in these biomes.
