## RainForests

**Caelmoss:** Caelmoss is a moss that covers the ground of the Rainforest of Alawo, which feeds via photosynthesis. What looks like rolling hills of grass from afar turn out to be covered in this hardy moss, which break down rocks, as well as break down dead flora and fauna. Caelmoss is known to reproduce via spores, which are blown away on the wind, and it’s found in forests, fields, and rocky wastelands. Caelmoss is also edible but consuming too much can cause light-headedness and vertigo. Caelmoss is slippery, especially if it’s healthy, and its spores let it reproduce sexually and asexually. There are camps divided on if its should be pronounced “kay-el-moss” or “ky-le-moss.”
