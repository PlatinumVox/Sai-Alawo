## RainForests

Each of the three largest rainforests has different species of plants and animals. Around 1/4th of the medicines come from rainforests. Curare, which is used to relax muscles during surgery, comes from a tropical vine. Quinine, which is used to treat malaria, comes from the cinchona tree. Rainforests are believed to have 1400 species of tropical plants that can cure cancer.
-   [Fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan) and [seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbill) [eaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteropus) - they're a huge [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peccary) of [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babirusa) and many plants rely on it for [seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agouti) dispersal. They occur in trees and on the [ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_forest_hog).
    
-   Nectar and pollen feeders - Pretty self-explanatory; these include beetles, bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, [moths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidoptera), [hummingbirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird), and [bats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tongued_nectar_bat).
    
-   Leaf eaters - Usually target newer, softer [leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar). Trees [evolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafcutter_ant) to make them [difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis_monkey) to [digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white_colobus) with spines and [toxins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoatzin) and have low nutritional [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth).
    
-   Ground-dwelling herbivores - most of the [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaur) is in the trees, so they are less [common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapir). They tend to be [large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_rhinoceros), but not many in number. Can still play [important](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla) roles in seed [dispersal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant).
    
-   Sap and phloem feeders - [self-explanatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrops_candelaria) as nectar [feeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_marmoset).
    
-   Decomposers - [decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite) happens very quickly in the rainforest.
    
-   Flesh-eating predators - these include [large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar) [predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger), [smaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelot) [predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viverridae), [birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy_eagle), and [snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_python).
    
-   Insectivores - [Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamandua), quite [self-explanatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin), but also [diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon) in [size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_anteater).
    
-   On a final note for rainforests, remember that environment also influences other things, such as locomotion. Rainforest animals will have prehensile tails, claws for hanging, hands adapted for clinging and leaping, or skin flaps for gliding between trees as possible adaptations for life in the trees.
