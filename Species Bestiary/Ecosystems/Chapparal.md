### Chapparal Biome
This biome is also known as the coastal scrub forest. Communities are dominated by shrubs and are known as chaparral. It experiences hot, dry summers; cool, moist winters; thin, nutrient-poor soils; periodic fires.

**Ferrite Grass** is a common grass that grows in a variety of climates on Alawo's hemisphere. As its name suggests, it absorbs and stores high quantities of iron, making consuming it a bad idea if your body uses calcium, but if you’re using iron in your biochemistry, it’s fine to consume. You can even boil it into tea and gather enough iron to make a bullet. **Ferrite Grass** is yellow, and lays limp. You may think it’s dead, but that’s how it is when it’s 100% fine, because it takes more energy to be erect, especially when dealing with gravity and the yellow pigment is natural. Plus, laying down means that more of its surface is exposed to the redshifted light it feeds on.
