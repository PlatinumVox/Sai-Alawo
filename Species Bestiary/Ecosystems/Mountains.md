**Rottshroom:** Rottshrooms are mushrooms with egg-shaped caps that are decomposers in the rocky barrens of Alawo They smell horrible, and this stench acts as a deterrent for [[Capral-Khaff]] who would want to eat their sweet, nutritious, edible caps. They will also attack by spraying their spores, which not only serve as a means to reproduce, but are very hard to get rid of, and smell rotten.
