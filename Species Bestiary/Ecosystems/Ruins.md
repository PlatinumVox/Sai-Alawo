**Ferrite Grass** is a common grass that grows in a variety of climates on Alawo's hemisphere. As its name suggests, it absorbs and stores high quantities of iron, making consuming it a bad idea if your body uses calcium, but if you’re using iron in your biochemistry, it’s fine to consume. You can even boil it into tea and gather enough iron to make a bullet. **Ferrite Grass** is yellow, and lays limp. You may think it’s dead, but that’s how it is when it’s 100% fine, because it takes more energy to be erect, especially when dealing with gravity and the yellow pigment is natural. Plus, laying down means that more of its surface is exposed to the redshifted light it feeds on.

**Luminshrooms** are tall, chemoautotrophic fungi that glow in a variety of colors, depending on what pigments they produce. Luminshrooms grow to be 5 m tall, with caps that are 2 m tall and 3 m in diameter. Their stems are 1-2 m in diameter. Luminshroom spores even glow and covering oneself with them is a good way to make sure you have enough light to explore the dark of inner ruins. When Luminshrooms die, they release nutrients right back into the soil, which encourages the growth of more Luminshrooms, and when spores from one mushroom touches another, spores for sexual reproduction are produced, and when those spores land, they begin growing. However, putting the spores on a solid surface, such as a rock or soil will allow for asexual reproduction.
