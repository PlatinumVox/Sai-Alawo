An Relicborne straddles the line between ghost and machine, an animated presence in a shell of relic-stuff. With no childhood to speak of the personality of an Relicborne develops over time from the moment of their awakening. Many strike out alone, defining their new lives by their actions, yet most eventually find themselves drawn back in some way to the ruins of the world.

**Of Gears and Ghosts**
The majority of Relicborne that assemble themselves from the detritus of shipwrecks, abandoned melded machinery and ruins. The Relicborne are far more varied in their appearance, often combining unusual materials and using whatever useful salvage is at hand.

**Personality**
Those unfamiliar with the Relicborne are often surprised by the complexity of their thoughts, expecting the logical simplicity of a golem or machine, but the Relicborne arenâ€™t driven by commands. Their souls and minds are their own, growing and developing along with their experiences and needs. Their personalities develop just like those of any other ancestory, and are similarly just as distinct.
