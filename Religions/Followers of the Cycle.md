The Followers of the Cycle are an (almost) exclusively Kaltoran religion, devoting themselves to the worship of their ancestors who have already passed into the Juggler Sea, as well as to building up the adherents' own mythology for when *they themselves*
pass into the sea.

***.*** Members take the existing ancestral memory of the Kaltoran peoples, and take that logic to its logical conclusion - we can request aid from those who are gone, as well as converse with them if we miss them. 

***.*** This leads to a sort of optimistic nihilism - life as all the others understand it is only one part of life in the world, and a highly temporary one at that.

***.*** This leads Followers of the Cycle to focus heavily on self improvement, as well as building a mythology around them, for the selfless reason of improving all Followers as a whole, and the selfish one of building their own mythology, ensuring their importance after the death of their physical forms.

***.*** Members are highly fixated on the idea of a "Good Death"-something dramatic and notable, that will pass them into legend when they die, talked about for generations to come.

***.*** Many members choose to undertake their Curtain Call at the height of the March of the Juggler-a final performance, putting all of their skills to new heights, before the sea returns to its normal height, claiming them with it.
