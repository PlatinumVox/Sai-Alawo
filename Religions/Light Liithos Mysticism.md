An explicit counter to the beliefs of Dark Liithos Mysticism, Light Liithos is a banned, heretical subcult of Dark Liithos.

***.*** Rather than venerating their ancestors for being as great as they are terrifying, they view the ancestors as vile-fools who died and left the world a ruin that still murders their descendants to this day.

***.*** Known to themselves as Lightbringers and to their foes as Bookburners, the adherents of Light Liithos seek to destroy all the remains of the Ancients-both in history and in remains, to reset the world to a more peaceful state, free of the scars the Ancients left on the world, so that it can rise anew.

***.*** This can run from the obvious (destroying historical archives) to the very long-term-minded (engineering species to be invasive, as well as more domesticated and posthumanity-beneficial, and placing them into the wild to outcompete the animals native to there.)
