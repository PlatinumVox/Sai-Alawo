**The Dark**

The Dark, God Itself, the custodian of the Dark dimension, stands at the head. Having created the universe by clashing with the light, it is the supreme being of the universe that it is half-responsible for. However, God does not bother with the affairs of the mixed plane. It delegates the duties of administering the universe to various agents, in a clear, descending hierarchy.

**Otsmas, The Great Confessor**

Otsmas, the Great Confessor, The Greatest Deliverer, sits at the hand of God. He is recognized as the custodian of the mixed plane and central figure of Dark Liithos Mysticism. All services must include prayers to him alongside whatever Intercessor the service is dedicated to, in eternal thanks for his work and compassion for those scorned by the Light-worshippers. Light worshippers are often recognized as outsiders to the Liithos religion.

**Ancients; Deliverers**

The Deliverers take the positions of the gods in other polytheistic religions. Created by God over time, even to today, as stewards for Its domains, they’ve became known under different names by the various peoples of the Realm; being created before Nephilimkind, the Ancients, the Deliverers transcend ideas such as gender or sexuality. 

Thus, many Deliverers are known in different forms. There is, for example, the Deliverer of sex, fertility, and parenting, known by Nephilim as a variety of names, the most common being Kad. Moreover, certain gods and goddesses of heathen faiths are revealed to be Deliverers to convert and assimilate foreign religions; 

The various ethnicities of the realm and even some foreign peoples have their own Deliverer dedicated to them, such as Hrafin, Deliverer to the Bandits. They are called Deliverers because miracles and other such works are accomplished by their design. If a mortal wishes for a Deliverer to grant them a miracle, they must pray not to the Deliverer themself, but to…

**Intercessors**

The Intercessors are the divine messengers and errand-runners of the Dark dimension. Unlike other polytheistic religions, one does not simply speak directly to the Deliverers to solve their problems. The Intercessors exist for specific issues; for example, one prays to the Intercessor Tonorus if they require the Wisdom Deliverer’s assistance in tomorrow’s exam. Like Deliverers, Intercessors are still being appointed right now, and may be anyone the Dark deems worthy of such an honor. The Hierarchs declare, through a complex process of rituals, divinations, and investigations, new Intercessors for a specific issue.
