**Kardash**
A host of broken holy cities, mostly reduced to dust or submerged beneath the waves, are all that remains of pre-War Kardash. The punishing storms ensure few relics survive to evoke the world that was. The restless All-Sea surges and recedes, often hundreds of
miles a day, her chaotic dance as unpredictable as the winds and quakes that drive her mad.

Below the waves Kardash comes alive. Networks of domed cities spider-webbed across the sea floor, fed by forests of kelp, schools of fish, and beds of crustaceans, heated by volcanic vents and inhabited by the majority of the Kaltoran race.

**Life Finds a Way**
The greatest engineers and technicians in the Nepilim-Atol raced to redefine their world during the final years of the Alboli-Nephilim War, building incredible redoubts hidden from their enemies beneath miles of ocean. 

Hubs of subterranean “pit cities” built under massive Electro-Gravity shields to hold the oceans at bay and configured with large central pressurized chambers, buildings hugging the circumference and connected by a skunk-works of tunnels made up the majority of the
engineers’ brave new underwater world. The result of their herculean and inspired efforts sadly did not yield unmitigated success. 

**Collapse** 
During the height of the war, several of the hubs failed utterly, suffering total loss of power, or worse, their Electro-Gravity domes surrendering to the punishing pressure of the eating Juggler Sea. For seventy years, Kardash wallowed in Darkness. The strong fed on the weak. Civilization ripped itself apart, and the most cosmopolitan and illuminated Kaltorans of the old theocracy fell to feral Dark Tribe savages. The desperate fled through tunnels towards other minor Hubs, throwing themselves by the thousands against emergency shields coldly lowered by their neighbors, who feared that the madness might spread.

**Resettlement**
Dozens of other smaller hubs surrendered to the vicissitudes of pressure, food shortage, and gravity-tech malfunctions over the course of the Dark Years until they knew that enough was enough and they began resettlement and taking back land from the Nephilim

The floor of the East Juggler Sea is a strange graveyard of still cities, scattered between deep rifts and latticed fields of coral. Many horribly eaten away and crumbling both from bomb blasts and consumption of the Juggler.
