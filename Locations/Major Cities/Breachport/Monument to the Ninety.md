A pyramid-shape which is still more or less intact. It was a very low structure, almost lost in the Mulch, but it was picked out by searchlights arcing down from above.

Of course, it hadn't really bothered the Transmigrants that their bodies were destroyed in the course of the scanning. But when the simulations themselves started to fail, no one was quite so happy. There had been seventy-nine volunteers in the first wave of Transmigrants-Ninety if you counted Calvin himself-and the majority of those simulations had stopped running long before the plague began to attack the logical substrates on which they were being computed. To commemorate the dead, they had built a vast and dejected Monument to the Ninety in the centre of the city, where shrines of the departed were tended by those relatives who remained corporeal. It was still there, after the plague had come.
