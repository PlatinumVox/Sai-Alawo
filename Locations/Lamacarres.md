"In the quest to be closer to ancients Nephlilm will often pilgrimage to the highest peaks and largest depths of the world's skin. In their end of life Nephilim and other followers of the ancients will often give themselves to the peaks. To the highest of mountain peaks in Alawo, [[Lamacarres]], my final eyes now gaze, not only its head but it's shoulders too bore a thick shroud of snow, which had nearly descended to its waist. I could not say, and perhaps no one now could, what proud a face it was that stared westward over so many lesser summits; but surely they had ruled in the earliest of the great ancients, and had commanded energies that could shape granite as a carver's knife does wood. Even the most upper echelons of Nephilim society might stand in awe of them and their strengths over mere mortal beings such as I."
