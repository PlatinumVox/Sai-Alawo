# Chapter One
### Setting

### Core Concepts
This page highlights the most important aspects of the world - the core concepts of the Wildsea. If you have a little more time, the rest of the chapters delves into more detail.

**Cultural Tension**
Shaped by the Alboli-Nephilim War and what it took to survive it, the races
have had one hundred years to create their own distinctive cultures,
formed from their experiences, core beliefs, and genetic nature.

*» What do you live for?*

**Genetic Engineering**
Humanity is long dead, but they managed to created their own
genetically engineered successors and leave behind remenants of themselves in the form of roaming ancient machines known as the [[Liocrae]].
*» What responsibility comes with the ability to make life?*

**Exploration**
This new society is built not only on the ruins of the J'van’
empire, but also on top of the ancient human empire and who knows
what else.

*» What is out there?*

### Lost Bloodlines
- J'van & Ancients 

### Core Three
The three ancestors represented here are those most commonly found building communities across the ruins; the Alboli, the Kaltoran, and the Nephilim. Each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and are uniquely adapted to life amongst the ruins.

### Rising Two
- Liocrae & Relicborne 

**The Alawoian Planet**

### **History; Short Story**
“History is a tricky thing. You’d think that it would be static… and
it is. But like anything, it changes depending on what angle you look
at it from, and the longer you look, the more nuanced it becomes.”
Gregory sunk back into his office chair as he settled in for a long
discussion with his dear friend, Grofix the [[Nephilim]].

It had been a long shift, and both friends were keen to make the
most of the temporary stillness in Gregory’s office to indulge their
philosophical and intellectual pursuits

“Thas iz troo.” Grofix took a seat on the nearby coffee table. The
fact that none of the many chairs in the room could accommodate
his tail said a lot about the type of people Gregory was “supposed”
to entertain in the Rafanese Trade Company. “Itz also doos not helps that wees ar trying to
look buck thruw ten thousand yeargs of time and thruw manyz
collapsed empires.”

Even Gregory found it hard to understand his friend’s heavy accent
at times. He often repeated what he had just heard, to make sure he
had listened correctly – a form of “active listening” as he liked to
think of it.

“Yes, we are trying to look back over a long time and through the
haze of many fallen empires, the greatest of these clearly being the
ancients, and only the religious dare to speculate what came before
them.” Gregory took a cigar from his desk drawer as he keyed the
word “ancients” into his [[Bio-Computer]]'s search program.

**Ancients**
“The problem with talking about a long-dead race, one which has
shaped our universe so much, is that we can’t help but reduce them
down to a caricature. A soulless list of notable achievements and
failures.” Gregory fiddled with his unlit cigar as he thought about
where to start. “While I’m sure ancients were just as culturally diverse
as us, how can we know for sure? Maybe they invented emotions,
currency… and family.”

That last point struck a painful emotional chord in Gregory’s
capitalistic heart.

“Weez cans specululate all night if youz want. But we dontz haz
time.” Empathy did not come easily to Grofix; it wasn’t in his DNA so to speak.
But even he could emulate it, if it would make this information
exchange more efficient. “Whatz is this ‘soullezz’ list?”
Gregory quickly regained his composure, lighting his cigar.
“We can’t be exactly sure about the order of events; the
Bio Search gives them as follows:

- Rise of the Ancients
- Seeding of the [[Pattern Jugglers]] 
- Creation of their Predecessors
- Creation of Alboli and Nephilim
- Rise of Alboli Empire
- Alboli-Nephilim War
- Formation of the Kaltorans
- Rise of the Nephilim Domination; Killing of their Masters
- First Melding Plague
	- Loss of Bio Technology
- Decay of the Nephilim
- Kaltoran Land Generation
- Dark Tribe Rise
- Secondary Melding Plague
	- Loss of Mechanical Technology
- Present Day


“But the ancients became stale. They stopped learning, advancing,
travelling, or growing.”

“Thass what happenz when you stop fightin for life.”
“Evidently…” While Gregory’s idea of healthy conflict was far less
physical than his friend’s, he did agree. “… Leading to their genetic
erosion, and a breakdown in their biological diversity. They died in
the billions to disease, famine, and birth defects, troubles they had
forgotten how to fight. Out of desperation, they created their undoing.

**The Pattern Jugglers**
“… A genetically engineered race, created to replace the ancients and preserve them.

Gregory paused for a moment; any thought of his creators, the
J'van, brought up complex thoughts and feelings.
“They iz like your negligant parenttz and myz estranged
grandparents,” Grofix mused. He never quite knew how to think of the
Jugglers. 

“Not wanting to tread in the footprints of their creators, the
J'van did not work towards rediscovering what humanity had
formerly achieved. Rather, they pushed out in a different direction, most prominently in repopulating their inherited empire with their
own genetically engineered creations.

Gregory started to seethe as he brought to mind what the J'van had made the Nephilim do to his people. Closing down his computer screen, he shared
his own raw thoughts.

**Twelve Devwis**
“After three thousand years and hundreds of new species, the
J'van thought they had finally created the perfect race, worthy of
the title ‘Devwi.” Gregory rotated his chair to face the large transparent
Synth Steel window, giving him a fantastic view of the large sprawling city below of Breachport, teeming with life and culture.

“Thatz iz correct,” Grofix also got up to look out the window. “Butz
the J'van change their minds, they think they notz worth it… how
many Devwi had been made at this pointz?”
“Twelve… they were still in the genetics lab where they had been
created. Not yet given their own world.” An awkward smile crossed
his face as he voiced a thought: “Imagine if they had been given their
own world and allowed to breed.”

“Thenz I darz say we would notz be talkin here as friendz.”
“True.” Gregory stood up to get a better view of the planet and
the space station they were on. “The Devwi did not take the J'van’
removal of their title well. I imagine the fight that followed was
brutal. But the Devwi did not stand a chance; the J'van flew in
reinforcements and quickly killed all of theDevwi… all but one… He,
she… it… doesDevwi have a gender?”
“Don’t knowz.”

“Well ‘it’ stole a craft and fled out into uncharted undergrounds of Alawo, the
J'van giving chase for almost five years according to the local speculation.”

It wouldz bee back.”

“Yes, but it’s worth talking about the changes to J'van
culture first.”

Grofix turned to look directly at Gregory. This was the part of the
story he had heard very little about.

“The J'vans became ideologically fractured over differing
perspectives on ‘perfection’ and the need to test their existing
children. Many J'vans thought they needed trials of hardship to
grow and prove themselves, while other J'vans pushed for all
current genetic projects to be halted.”

“Isnt itz strange that we carez about all zisss so muchz.”

“Not strange at all; in many ways our culture and history shape
us more than our genetics.”

This idea was contrary to Grofix’s upbringing, where the nature of
one’s birth defined one’s entire life. But if this belief was the result of
his cultural upbringing, then it only added weight to Gregory’s point.
“History shapes us, especially momentous history, like war.”

**The Great Alboli-Nephilim War**

Two sides were ineviably drawn in the coming war, the Devwi with it's underground army against he J'van and their Alboli children.

“When Devwi returned, it brought a diverse army of genetically
engineered warriors.” Gregory looked at Grofix. “Your people, the
Nephilim, as you have come to be named.”

“Myz great great grand mother fought during that warz.”
“Are many who fought in the war still alive?”
“Yes, manyz… at leastz an 1/8 of the peoplz from my city.” Grofix
thought for a little while. “We callz the older Nephilim ‘Purebloods’.
We suspectz sumz of them can livs for hundrez of yearz. Butz I am
notz a Pureblood; I amz a ‘Hybrid’ as I comez from two different
Pureblood species of parentz. Us Hybrids we is veryz diverse.”
But we arz off topic; lez get back to the war.”

“Yes, well… while it was technically a war, it was closer to a
slaughter. Devwi’s army of Nephilim and fleets of organic craft
laid waste to almost every area of the planet with nuclear, biological, and ground combat. Some of the J'vans in their stupidity welcomed the war,
thinking that it would not only test their children but also themselves.”
“Yuz, they werz tested… and found lacking. Theyz all deadz now.”
“Once Devwi had killed the last J'van, it just left. Abandoning its
army, your people. No one knows why.”

Grofix did not know how to feel about this. He had not fought during
the war and held no allegiance to his creator.

**Re-Emergence**
Nearly Three Hundred years later and  we are only now just starting to grasp
what happened back then.” Gregory sat back at his desk, bringing
up a projection on the wall of their solar system, the Haven system. “Your people survived, alongside mine, the Kaltorans and the Alboli. We are all now acting outside the scope of our original design.

“Tey possibly leftz uszz to learn to standz on our own?”
“I have heard thousands of ideas as to how this is all part of the
‘Creator’s’ plan. I choose not to believe that; they were created just
like us. Flawed, just like us.”

Grofix paced the room thoughtfully as Gregory smoked.
“Butz wherez we at nows? Everything hangs on a thread…
