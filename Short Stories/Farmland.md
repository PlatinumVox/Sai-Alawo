This Nephilim-Founded Experimental Farm is Crushing Stereotypes
#shortstory

Today Rafanese Ledger is participating in an interview with two farmers deep in the heart lands of Dahani Triumvirate, Naje and Podi Deqonnee.

“Part of what we’re doing here is developing a relationship to place,” Naje said. Their frustration with living in a city was the inability to connect in long term and meaningful ways.  They see engaging with land as an opportunity for themselves and for their community to reclaim much of what gets lost on an individual and societal level in Dahani Triumvirate Capitalistic systems: “An opportunity to tap into seasonality, death, decay, rebirth… These natural cycles that you’re disconnected from in cities and modern life.”

Coming from the city, but not fully “farmers,” they have found themselves in a liminal space straddling many worlds. “There is a life between rural and urban. There is a way to provide stability for yourself and your family that isn’t just a desk job and isn’t just farming. We’re experimenting with this new life-model that has the best of the more technologically oriented urban world and the ecologically-centered rural world.”

The two recently travelled into the Marian United Republic and attended their Academies of Community Farming. Wherein they learned of the permaculture practice in modern Kaltoran society of _Ecotones_, or transition areas between two biological communities where the two meet and integrate. “The whole idea is where two different ecosystems meet each other, the boundary between those two things—wild and fantastic shit happens,” Podi said. “It’s kind of fun to think about Nephilim culture and farming as these two different ecosystems, and seeing what happens at that edge.”

They’ve already found the joy that comes in bringing nephilim cultural practices into farming, an industry that has the reputation of being dusty, brutal, and backbreaking. “It’s fun to have a bunch of partners up here and dress cute and farm in the garden and talk about celebrations of colour and loving of community that has been supressed in our modern culture. It changes the stereotype of what this type of work is—because it _is_ playful and fun and bright.”

As they look towards the road ahead for the new style of Nephilim farming, they’re imagining “an experimental and educational agrotourism event space: a combination of a homestead, a small-scale farm, and an events area.” They’ll dot the back of their property with small cabins for people to stay for a short or medium amount of time to learn about new models of living while participating in workshops and engaging with the farm. All the while they’ll connect their urban, city community and their farming, rural community to see how they can help each other, ultimately benefiting the broader province and Dahani region.

With the end goal of creating a sustainable and equitable future where people participate in a reciprocal relationship to the planet and each other, their farm is a subversive and radical project in the middle of Dahani hyper capitalism. Their mission—to explore what a new way of what life can look like—is culturizing the way we move forward, together.
