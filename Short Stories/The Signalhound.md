The Signalhound
#shortstory
Day 78.
In search of artifacts.
Traveling by personal [[Dirigible]].

Far from civilization and deep into the wild of the White Gum Wastes, an area bristling with dangers and artifacts. I came upon a lone Indigenous Alboli, and tired of solitude decided to strike up a conversation. Her eyes set on the heavens, she adjusted a nearby antenna and bid me to wait. Soon enough my eyes caught the glint of an ancient orbital against the rising dawn, and in her radio came to life the lonely buzz of a machine-speech voice.

The meaning of the orbitalâ€™s words was lost to me, but not to my companion. They quickly explained in broken Sanasian that it was the voice of a distantly ancient planetary gun still calling for its lost home. The signal fell to the ground beneath us, where the command vault of some lost nation still laid unspoiled.

Knowing of the dangers of ancient [[ruins]] and of its guardians, I excused myself on some false pretext. Once I was sure to be out of sight, I started running, and did not stop until nightfall.
