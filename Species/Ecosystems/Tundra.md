### Gum Tundra

TheÂ Arctic tundra is a frosty, unlivable, treeless territory of low, swampy fields in the north and south of the world. The ground of the Arctic tundra has forever solidified subsoil, called permafrost, which makes it hard for trees to develop. Many fossils have been found in the permafrost that is located in these biomes.
