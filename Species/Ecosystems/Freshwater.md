### Freshwater Biome
Water is a major natural resource that is the basis of life. It supports life, and countless species live in it for all or part of their lives. Freshwater biomes supply us with our drinking water and water for crop irrigation. This water biome is named for the low concentration of salt found in the water. Because salt is important for the body to function properly, the plants and animals here have many adaptations that help them save salt. This includes most ponds, streams, lakes, and rivers.
