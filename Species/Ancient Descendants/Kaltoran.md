**Spectres of the Past**
Born with the genetic memories of their ancestors, Kaltorans
are an innately gifted and flexible race. They are eager to make a
new future for themselves, though they struggle with the “genetic
memories” of not only the Great Nephilim-Alboli War but the extreme measures
taken by their ancestors to survive it.

 The genocide of the Kaltorans during the Great Nephilim-Alboli was monstrous; it has been said that the Kaltorans suffered most in the war. The Kaltorans were originally an offshoot of refugee Nephilim living on islands off the eastern coasts. In the end, their home continent, Eden, was turned from a beautiful, fertile island nation into a poisoned wasteland. The few Kaltorans who survived fled to to the floating city of Kardash, where they descended to the bottom of the ocean and built undersea settlements. Huddled in the deep and the dark, the survivors planned to never again see the surface world.

**New Life of Foundry**
The return to a better life began with a new generation of Kaltorans who were tired of living in constant fear. Restarting an ancient reactor, these Kaltorans seized its power for hydroponics and lights, and they restored their eyesight and the eyesight of their children through biological and electronic implants. This rebuilding of society became known as the Founding, and those Kaltorans as the Founders. However, not all Kaltorans were ready for a new world, and many Dark Tribes remained in the tunnels below the now crumbling Kardash as it succumbed to the eating of the [[Pattern Jugglers]] in the Sea while most others began a push back on land.

This push back inevitably led to the Kaltoran capture of now Nephilim held lands into the hands of the Founders. With this the Kaltorans founded many separate Tribes, mostly by ideology.

These 30 tribes lasted hundreds of years until an ideology of equality arose. These 30 tribes came together through war and equal representation to form the **General Kaltoran Caucus**, a representive body of the major cultural groups of the new Mari Nation.
