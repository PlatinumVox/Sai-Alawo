**Appearance**
Skin colours: Skin colors often stay closer to human shades

**Personality**
Overcompensating for the failures of their ancestors, Kaltorans are often overly optimistic, passionate, and eager for a clean slate and a better future.

**Society**
With large families and limited living space, they have learnt to make the most of their limited resources, creating eclectic and dense cities. Kaltoran businesses are frequently run from within family homes or directly from a downed spacecraft’s cargo hold, often selling raw minerals, fish, or weapons.

Kaltorans have a very small and focused government that only deals with major social concerns. Local laws are dictated by prominent family Elders and popular opinion. Few rules are enforced, but those that are, are often dealt with severity and quickly: all Kaltorans carry a weapon – even children and especially the elderly.
