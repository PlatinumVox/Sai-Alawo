**==Overview==**
**Genetic Memories**
At conception, Kaltoran child has a mind seeded with memories from both parents, grandparents, great grandparents, and perhaps even older ancestors. For each generation
back a memory is, the harder it is to retain. These often-foggy memories are slowly gained as the Kaltoran goes through puberty. This trait is a mixed blessing. The Kaltorans benefit from the skills and knowledge of their ancestors, but they are also cursed by
terrible and haunting memories of their troubled history.

**Enhanced Senses**
The Kaltorans are gifted with an exceptional sense of hearing, heightened further during their generations of time in the darkness. Many older Kaltorans were born blind, but the bio-tech remedy is relatively simple, and most Kaltorans have perfect vision as well as
exceptional hearing.

**Long Lifespan**
Due to exception genetic coding, Kaltorans have long natural lifespans. Maturing quickly and ageing slowly, they are in their prime for far longer. Their lifespan leads to large families and allows older Kaltorans to still work and fight. Unfortunately, due to their brutal history, many Dark Tribe Kaltorans never lived to their elder years. 

**Spectres of the Past**
Born with the genetic memories of their ancestors, Kaltorans
are an innately gifted and flexible race. They are eager to make a
new future for themselves, though they struggle with the “genetic
memories” of not only the Great Nephilim-Alboli War but the extreme measures
taken by their ancestors to survive it.

 The genocide of the Kaltorans during the Great Nephilim-Alboli was monstrous; it has been said that the Kaltorans suffered most in the war. The Kaltorans were originally an offshoot of refugee Nephilim living on islands off the eastern coasts. In the end, their home continent, Eden, was turned from a beautiful, fertile island nation into a poisoned wasteland. The few Kaltorans who survived fled to to the floating city of Kardash, where they descended to the bottom of the ocean and built undersea settlements. Huddled in the deep and the dark, the survivors planned to never again see the surface world.

**New Life of Foundry**
The return to a better life began with a new generation of Kaltorans who were tired of living in constant fear. Restarting an ancient reactor, these Kaltorans seized its power for hydroponics and lights, and they restored their eyesight and the eyesight of their children through biological and electronic implants. This rebuilding of society became known as the Founding, and those Kaltorans as the Founders. However, not all Kaltorans were ready for a new world, and many Dark Tribes remained in the tunnels below the now crumbling Kardash as it succumbed to the eating of the [[Pattern Jugglers]] in the Sea while most others began a push back on land.

This push back inevitably led to the Kaltoran capture of now Nephilim held lands into the hands of the Founders. With this the Kaltorans founded many separate Tribes, mostly by ideology.

These 30 tribes lasted hundreds of years until an ideology of equality arose. These 30 tribes came together through war and equal representation to form the **General Kaltoran Caucus**, a representive body of the major cultural groups of the new Mari Nation.


**Ancestors**
The Kaltorans practice a religion of praying to ancestors for guidance. This is more than an unfounded superstition for them, as they have access to the genetic memory of their ancestors. A Kaltoran might meditate on a problem or question and pray to their
ancestors for help, often finding the answer to their question deep in their ancestral memories. Because these prayers for knowledge are answered, the Kaltorans give reverence to the ancestors as thanks. Families often have busts or sculptures of especially revered ancestors on altars in their homes.

**Feuds**
Because families are distinct units and no central government exists, feuds between families are common. Some families have grudges that go back a hundred years, and their genetic memories guarantee that any slight will not be forgotten. Since the Founding,
many families have turned murderous feuds into competitive rivalries.

**Another Broken Creation**
The Kaltorans are in many ways a broken ancestry; their gift of genetic memory has become a curse due to their violent past. As such, they sympathize with other broken ancestor races, one of which being the Mechanoids. Where other races kill Mechanoids without thought the Kaltorans wish to understand them. But this curiosity won’t stop
them from killing a Mechanoid if it puts them or their family in danger.

**Algaeic Reproduction**

.they basically have minor control over the alage in their skin and with that they can chose who they want to reproduce with and who gets pregnant

**==Sub Speciation ==**
**Founder**
Of all the Kaltorans, the Founders are the most industrious: they built the present Kaltoran civilization from the ashes of the past. While they are fond of tradition and find change hard, they understand that it is necessary and inevitable. Many Founders leave
their homes in order to make a better life for their families, often working as merchants or explorers.

**Pioneer**
These Kaltorans tend to be young, adventurous, and fun-loving. They are often reckless thrill-seekers, keen to prove themselves to their families and to make new memories for their future children. Eager to make their mark on the Alawo continent, they take their sense
of personal justice with them and often get themselves into trouble when the laws of the other ancestries (especially the Nephilim) do not serve their idea of the common good.

**Dark Tribes**
Dark and brooding, many among the Dark Tribes are as paranoid as they are dangerous. Those who leave the familiar darkness of their homes are often exiles or seeking to settle a score with the Alboli. These blind (and often cannibalistic) warriors are infamous throughout Alawo continent, despite their rarity.
