**Carved by the Ice**
Though the changes from their ancestral human stock may be minimal in terms of
appearance other than their thicker skin pockmarked with scales on major points of wear, they run far deeper than the surface - the Alboli excel in sheer survivability,
with even their bodies  clinging tenaciously to the world after death. The poisons
and plagues of the continent seem to pass them by, and even simpler hazards like
spoiled food are easily ignored.

**The [[White Gum Wastes]]**
Many Alboli still hold a strong connection to the wastes, a blazing cold reach of ruins poking through ice far to the north. It's not the current state of the reach that intrigues and pulls them back and shapes their society, but its history - in the pre-war era the desert played host to a huge empire of black and white stone worshipping and living within the ruins of the ancients, the greatest achievement of this now-scattered Alboli civilization who once spanned the continent in power.

**Temperature of Life**
