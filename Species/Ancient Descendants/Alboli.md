**Carved by the Ice**
Though the changes from their ancestral human stock may be minimal in terms of
appearance other than their thicker skin pockmarked with scales on major points of wear, they run far deeper than the surface - the Alboli excel in sheer survivability,
with even their bodies  clinging tenaciously to the world after death. The poisons
and plagues of the continent seem to pass them by, and even simpler hazards like
spoiled food are easily ignored.

**The [[White Gum Wastes]]**
Many Alboli still hold a strong connection to the wastes, a blazing cold reach of ruins poking through ice far to the north. It's not the current state of the reach that intrigues and pulls them back and shapes their society, but its history - in the pre-war era the desert played host to a huge empire of black and white stone worshipping and living within the ruins of the ancients, the greatest achievement of this now-scattered Alboli civilization who once spanned the continent in power.

**The History of Us**

For three hundred long years the Alboli was under the assumption that they were under a pogrom, any contact with Nephilim was a death sentence. Unexpectantly, the Nephilim extended an olive branch of first peaceful contact after nearly three hundred years.  This first contact created chaos, and the Alboli commanders (Casila Curia) struggled to relate to these new outsiders. 

Mere days after their first meeting, Nephilim triumvirate members began offering mercenary jobs to the Alboli. Over the course of that first year, almost two million Alboli deserted Hantin to join the Nephilim. Scrambling to control the situation, the Casila Curia issued an edict that all deserters could never return to Hantin and labeled them Exsilia, meaning exiled soldiers.

This was an unpopular move, as many families had been lifted from poverty due to the resources sent back home by the Exsilia, despite being labelled Exsilia. In response, the government formed a Foreign Branch along with a new army of official Alboli mercenaries,
the Auxilia. Large numbers of Alboli soldiers transferred from the Interior Branch to the Auxilia to become mercenaries. 

**Exsilia versus Auxilia**

As the tensions rose between Exsilia and Auxilia, cracks began to form in the governing body that remained in the north after the Long Nephilim-Alboli conflict and genocide. With these cracks, warlords were able to push through, splintering what remained of a governing body into warring factions of Khaganates.

**Temperature of Life**
.Alboli are the most "traditional" in terms of actually having gender, where theyre all born female but if theyre raised in cold theyre male but in warmth theyre female


**==Sub Speciation ==**
**Nomad**
During their early years of resettlement, many Alboli left their
overcrowded roaming cities to become nomadic arctic hunters and gatherers,
determined to take charge of their own destinies and to live by their wits and skill. Many of these Nomads have now moved to the White Gum Wastes
system to again find a better life.

**Specialist**
The Fractured Khaganate army has many specialists in addition to their regular
soldiers. Specialists are trained in overcoming problems and obstacles
by using technological expertise to find and exploit weaknesses in
their enemies. They take their time in combat, analyzing the situation
and applying their considerable skills as needed.
