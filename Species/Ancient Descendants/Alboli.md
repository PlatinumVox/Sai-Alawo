**Personality**

**Society**
Alboli culture is very rigid with many heavily enforced laws. Very protective of their homes, few outsiders are able to visit their small and heavily fortified cities. Settlements have few businesses, as food and other supplies are distributed according to need.

A lot changed for the Alboli after they made contact with the other races. The attraction of living a life of action has proven a strong incentive for many Alboli. Giving up their pursuit of a self-sustaining society, many now act as mercenaries and enforcers.

 Old grudges have made interactions with the Nephilim difficult, but the situation is currently stable. They enjoy a natural comradeship with the Kaltorans as they share similar goals despite their contrasting natures.
