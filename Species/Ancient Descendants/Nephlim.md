**Personality**

**Society**
Pure bloods are ancient Nephilim who fought for survival with the ancients as slaves are seen as pure blood descendants. Often large and imposing, they are a living reminder of their people’s past service to their creator, the Ancients.

Hybrids are the diverse and mixed offspring of the pure bloods. Diverse in appearance and nature, Hybrids make up the bulk of the Nephilim population.

Nephilim culture has very few laws and is only stabilized by the self-serving wills of its powerful leaders, who are largely unconcerned with the masses.

While the Nephilim are easily the most powerful military force on the continent, they know that long-term survival and prosperity depends on their forming some kind of functional relationship with the other races – a feat that is incredibly difficult given their war history, old ties to Ancients, appearance, and brutal culture.
