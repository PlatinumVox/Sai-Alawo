**Culture of Capital**

Largely motivated by a desire for personal success and shaped by social expectations, Nephilim culture is deceptively simple to outsiders. While most Nephilim are materially well provided for, nearly all present an image of greater personal success than they have actually achieved, especially around other Nephilim. No matter how impoverished, every Nephilim will have at least one set of expensive-looking clothes to wear in public. The most wealthy high bloods frequently throw extravagant parties to firmly establish public knowledge of their success

Nephilim mostly live on large, crowded, and hastily constructed
cities that carefully surround the remnants that were left long ago by the ancients that they now venerate. All of their cities have large central plazas full of garish advertisements and shops, and surrounded by large [[Dirigible]] ports.



**The Soup of Sex**

.Nephilim are kind of the same but are able to sexually reproduce but with however many partners they choose in kind of soup
