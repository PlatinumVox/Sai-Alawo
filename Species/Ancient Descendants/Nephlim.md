**Culture of Capital**
Largely motivated by a desire for personal success and shaped by social expectations, Nephilim culture is deceptively simple to outsiders. While most Nephilim are materially well provided for, nearly all present an image of greater personal success than they have actually achieved, especially around other Nephilim. No matter how impoverished, every Nephilim will have at least one set of expensive-looking clothes to wear in public. The most wealthy high bloods frequently throw extravagant parties to firmly establish public knowledge of their success

Nephilim mostly live on large, crowded, and hastily constructed
cities that carefully surround the remnants that were left long ago by the ancients that they now venerate. All of their cities have large central plazas full of garish advertisements and shops, and surrounded by large [[Dirigible]] ports.

**The Dozen Gentiles** 
Twelve Gentiles were created by the Nephilim-Predecessors, The **J'van**, and they were declared to be a perfect species. However, this title was soon rescinded, and out of anger at their rejection, the Nephilim tried to slay their creators. They failed, and only one, Gentile survived, the original Devwi survived.

The Nephilim were made to be exquisitely engineered organisms, created for the sole purpose of destroying the Alboli. They fulfilled their purpose during the Great Nephilim War, laying waste to the Alboli and culture creations. This army was organized into broods, each with a unique purpose. Devwi Pure bloods were created specifically to annihilate the Alboli.

The Devwi Brood did their task well. They took Cyrene, the capital of the Alboli, and ruined it. They scoured the continent until all Alboli were gone; when there were no more **J'van** to kill, the Devwi vanished into the underground. As the years dragged on and supplies ran low, the Devwi dug deeply into the earth and then it slumbered.

For almost three hundred years, the Devwi. While it slumbered its Nephilim brood was without purpose and order, and they devolved into wild animals or feral tribes.

With the remergence of the Kaltorans in the Alawo continent, the Devwi awoke. It reunited the tribes of Feral Nephilim. In the Kaltoran the Devwi saw an opportunity for building a new society for its brood. It forged an alliance with these newcomers, knowing that the only way for its brood to survive the ages was to create a new society with a purpose greater than destruction.

**Life is Cheap**
Created to be an un-empathetic warrior race with a short cultural history, the Nephilim often find it hard to understand why the other races are at times so averse to killing.

While each Nephilim often holds their own life in high regard, they rarely value the lives of others. This self-destructive and potentially devastating cultural trait would not only ruin their own society, but also their relationships with the other ancestors of Ancients, if not for
the foresight of their leaders who often enforce restraint on their subordinates â€“ often, ironically, through death or torture.

**Pursuit of Perfection**
The Nephilim are driven towards the singular purpose of genetic perfection, seeking to improve their own genes and the genes of their offspring. Those who have excellent genes are given a greater position in society, and those with poor genes are treated as inferior.
Unfortunately, perfection is subjective, and to improve yourself is only the first step of many, as you will need to prove to others rhat your genes are superior if you hope to gain recognition. Each Nephilim will try to do this in their own way, but sooner or later the stronger and more cunning Nephilim often find themselves in charge

This eugenicist attitude is reminiscent of J'van society. Most hold to the belief that  J'van did not create the Nephilim in the hopes of creating a perfect race, but simply to use them as a tool to crush the Alboli.

**Symbiotic Dependence**
The Devwi is as wise as it is immensely powerful. It has seen what happens to the Nephilim masses when they are left to their own devices. Despite their intelligence and strength, the Nephilim are ill-equipped to form a stable, long-lasting society without the
assistance of outsiders. With the long-term survival and prosperity of its brood in mind, the Devwi has sought to create a symbiotic relationship with the other races. Without the cultural diversity and resources of the other races to draw upon, the Devwi brood
would once again become a feral war machine.

*Will this pursuit towards a sustainable co-existence only last until the Nephilim are able to survive on their own? Many, especially the Alboli, suspect the Nephilim of only playing the role of friend until they no longer need the other races.*

**The Devwi**
The Devwi is rarely seen, and its exact nature is largely unknown. But none can deny that it is a powerful and cunning creature who commands the loyalty of the New Brood from an unknown location. It rules with absolute authority over the Triumvirate by right of its genetics.


**The Soup of Breeding**
 Nephilim are not gendered in the same way as the other ancestries; they do not often adhere to strict male and female reproductive distinctions.
 
Those Nephilim who can reproduce often do so by laying eggs and having many Nephilim (even one that can lay eggs) fertilize the eggs by excreting their DNA in a mucus. Most Hybrids are born in this way. Those whose genus unable to naturally reproduce often immerse themselves in pools of mutagenic fluid to extract their DNA, enabling them to fertilize eggs of their partner(s).

**==Sub Speciation ==**
**Jer-Lich; Pureblood**
Some Nephilim have survived since the Great Alboli-Nephilim War, while others are clones and purebred offspring. The Purebloods are perfect specimens of their original, Devwi-designed form. Each Pureblood genus has been engineered for a specific wartime purpose. Most are large, powerful, monstrous-looking creatures with admirable physical and mental ability.

**Deci-Si; Hybrid**
Born from a mixed Pureblood or Hybrid pairing, Hybrids are in many ways the opposite of their Pureblood parents or ancestors. Hybrids are adaptive, cunning, and flexible creatures. They are extremely varied and they are every bit as powerful as the Purebloods, arguably more so as they have thrived in great numbers while the Purebloods decline in Triumvirate Power.
