**Liocrae**

The Ancients ran into Liocrae first– in nature, oversized razor clams. These Liocrae, know in short hand as Worms (like Alboli, Kaltorans, Nephilim, and every other Modified creatures) aren’t completely artificial.

They’re an existing species that was crudely manipulated and conditioned to serve a role in the maintenance ecosystem.  Worms are actually weird shellfish that have been “shucked” and stuffed in robotic suits.  While their suits don’t age, the worm bodies do, and they need to be replaced every century or two. There are ancient facilities dedicated to making more worms.  However, unlike humanoids, worms can’t reproduce on their own. They’re essentially shellfish, designed to scatter genetic material into the tides. As a shell-less amalgam in a robot suit, they’re totally unable to do this. All Liocrae have a level of oddity, their aloofness inherent, their seems unnatural, their mentality alien.

**Diet**
While their favorite snack is plankton, algae, and other microorganisms present in water, a good substitute is sugar water. They can actually eat a variety of things, provided they’re blended and diluted with lots of water. Food generally has to be poured down a special port on the suit somewhere.

**Pilots of an Ancient World**
Originally designed to maintain the ecosystem and world of Alawo, worms continue their duty to this day and can be found in anything from;

-Massive Alboli walking cities, which were originally ice management devices

-Smaller carapaces for maintenance of major ancient facilities

-Communication stations floating in Pattern Juggler sea(s)

-Under water reef management devices

-Ring support networks to maintain terraforming networks

**Free Worms**

Among the Alawoian continent there are less than 1000 Liocrae, each one is unique and Worm Watchers, something of a subculture among [[Artificers]], can name each one by sight alone.  
  
With so few worms, It’s big news when a new one appears. The first thing a Free Worm deals with is a thorough inspection by the local authority on ancient and unusual things. Once they’ve been inspected and documented, worms are technically free to go. In practice, worms have no idea what to do, and they’re almost always taken in by whatever community they wandered in to.  
  
Fortunately, worms are clearly sapient, and Alawo cultures typically consider them to be people, despite the unusual shape and difficulty communicating.  
  
Kaltoran culture tends to characterize them as big children. They’re not children, and this attitude can be patronizing, but at least they get taken care of. The Kaltoran families that host worms are proud of their big, weird brethren, and take pleasure in helping them navigate the world. Worms still, unfortunately. gravitate towards being used for labor, but their family culture genuinely tries to avoid exploiting them. Kaltorans have a particular fondness for the strange, airy whistling noise the worms make through their hyper sensitive ears.

Nephilim views them as people in a “sink or swim, personal responsibility” kind of way. Worms are obligated to figure it out like any other person– they get what they deserve, what they earn. Pretty hard to “make it” in Nephilim if you can’t speak or sign a contract… yet, worms’ value as laborers makes Nephilim loathe to let them go to “waste”. With the help of sympathetic and/or enterprising caretakers, they often end up doing temp labor, especially in the mines and railroads. Not being able to enter into many agreements keeps them on the periphery of society, but it also protects them from the worst exploitation– and mercifully, there are very few worms in Dahani Triumvirate to begin with. Few enough to count on your fingers, of which the average Nephilim only have 6.

The Alboli might be the most equitable towards worms. They believe that a person’s capabilities are a gift from the divine, and it’s their duty to help people express them. Worms have different needs and gifts, but the principle is the same, and the Khans make a genuine if imperfect attempt to accommodate them. Worms are also more common in the Alboli than in the heartland or Nephilim. You may see more than one in the same place in the large roaming cities. Worms attracted to kins some may say.

**Life Beyond the Edge**
It’s pretty much impossible to live beyond the exposed part of the surface. No sunlight means you can’t farm, but more importantly, all of the ancient machinery is ALIVE. You simply can’t avoid custodians like you can in the larger world. Try and put up a building and they’ll notice and tear it down. Additionally there is a risk of Radiation, chemical pollution and artifact pollution.

Short hops under the “husk” are doable but very dangerous… one strategy is to go quietly and on foot, another strategy is to take the fastest airship you can and get in and out as quickly as possible. Speed, and “camouflage” are crucial.  Although you need to find the entrances that custodians will take in and out of the husk into the meat of the planet.
