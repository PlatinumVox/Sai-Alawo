A Pangolin variant living in symbiotic harmony with its environment, the Pangola's precious scales are covered with a thick layer of moss and flower-bloom. Though placid by nature and subject to environmental preservation by several forward-thinking Alawo communities (partly due to their genial moods and supposed ability to bring good luck), Pangola can deliver a bevy of powerful punches when threatened, their highly muscled arms as useful for brawling as they are for brachiation through trees and [[ruins]].

**Presence** 
**Sight**: Large animals covered in a dense thicket of greenery, three times taller than a humanoid 
**Sound:** Large thumps as it moves or heavily shifting detritus as it moves over crumbing [[ruins]] or trees.
**Smell:** Floral â€“ a mixture of mosses, earthy tones and fresh flowers that permeate deep into the nasal cavity. 
**Taste:** Pangola meat is most powerful quality appears to be its bizarre odor, which pungently can stink up the surrounding area. A hesitant nibble will reveal that it also will permeate the general flavor of the animal. Pangola meat is dark, with a sticky, stringy texture. The scales were just barely edible, with a crunch like a human fingernail.
