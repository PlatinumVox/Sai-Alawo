The Chameleon Yak is a long-haired domesticated bovid that has evolved a fascinating survival mechanism involving camouflage, similar to the way a chameleon changes its skin colour in response to different stimuli.

The Chameleon Yak takes this a step further, changing its very metabolism according to the environment it is inhabiting at the time.
