Frog-like lizards with wide mouths and long, dexterous tongues, Jikari tend to attack from above, snaring their targets and whipping them around.

 Jikari can leap large distances with their powerful limbs, pulling snared targets with them.

Their tongue, when used against small and lightly-armoured targets, the jikari winds its tongue around its victim from a distance and pulls them off their feet. Once a target is snared theyâ€™ll whip it around the environment, smashing it against objects until it gives up or gets free. Against heavier targets the tongue is fired out straight, the arrow-like tip hard enough to pierce armour.

Low croaking as they build anticipation. Whip-crack sounds when they launch their tongues.

Like old pond-scum.

Chewy, rubbery flesh with a hint of standing water.
