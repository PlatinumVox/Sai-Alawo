Vicious pack hunters descendant of martens that resembles a fox/dog with mustelid characteristic pack hunters with stiletto limbs, Wan-Martins are a seemingly omnipresent threat across the various reaches and territories of Sai Alawo.

Wan-Martins are many things - swift, voracious, smart and tenacious - but perhaps their largest threat comes from their mobility. Though many of beasts and insects have adapted to the endless ruined-borough-scape of Alawo, it could be argued that Wan-Martins have adapted perhaps the most effectively. Their limbs are equally as useful at finding a purchase on an animal's hide, digging into the thick bark of trees or punching through the metal of a ship's hull. If there's a place a Wan-Martin wants to go, there's a good chance it'll get there before long. They move as fast vertically as they do horizontally, and can attack their prey from just about any direction - some have eben been observed clinging to the undersides of ships as they travel, being carried into the supposed safety of a port and then spearing up to drag dockworkers down into the depths as they unload cargo.

To consume their captured prey a Wan-Martin will carve up their prey’s flesh with their needle sharp fore-limbs, once a section of meat is freed it will pick it up with their long, thick prehensile tongues into their mouth for digestion, to kill another day. Since their tongues are incredibly mobile and well-muscled, usually used to wrap around smaller prey and draw it close to the creature’s jaws. These tongues are also lined with delicate scent receptors, used to taste the air and allow the beasts to accurately track prey they can’t see.

Presence 
Sight: Bursts of uncanny movement. Long twitching tongues. Coarse fur and smooth skin underneath. 
Sound: The sharp impacts of their pin-like limbs. Hissing when they’re readying themselves to attack. Scraping and skittering if they move over metal. 
Smell: Musky - a mixture of sweat and old blood. 
Taste: Wan-Martin meat is tough, and tastes bitter unless charred or fried (when it’s then surprisingly buttery).
