These hideous half-bird creatures are rarely a threat, as they usually refrain from attacking all but the weakest of victims. [[Lascar]]s still hope to avoid the sight of them as wherever they are, death is near. They are scavengers, preying on the dead and dying. The little fur they have on their naked bodies stained with dried blood, they are agile climbers, known to circle above a creature breathing its last breaths by jumping from branch to branch and structure to structure. They are unlikely to attack, unless something or someone is attempting to steal a meal they already thought certain.

Drawn to death and decay, they are often spotted in particularly dangerous areas.
Because of this, they are seen as a bad omen by many. Some even believe they can sense disaster before it strikes.

With a strangling grip, Retchbeaks rarely attack but, if they do, they usually attempt to close their large hands or feet around the throats of their victims, choking them to death rather than hitting or biting them.

Some rumors speak of black-furred Retchbeaks who feast on not simply the mortal remains of their victims but their spirits as well.
