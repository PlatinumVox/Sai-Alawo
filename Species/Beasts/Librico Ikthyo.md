Rare creatures with an even rarer appetite, libricos are on an endless and voracious hunt for the printed word. They glut themselves on books and scrolls, drinking the ink and chewing the paper into nest-building pulp - it’s not the physical that they’re after, but
the nebulous whisper-like potential of words on a page. The libiri are something approaching an endangered species across the world, mostly due to the lack of new printed material being produced in the digitized age of Alawo. They’re far more commonly found worming through the passages of old ruins, temples to knowledge and schoolyards dredged up by the shifting of the sea.

Presence
Sight:
Ink-like slime on leaves. A pulsing mass of
leathery flesh. Discarded book-covers.
Sound:
The spurting of ink. A wet slap of flank.
Smell:
Dusty, damp, a library with a leaking roof.
Smell:
Blood bitter like ink, but butter-like hide.
