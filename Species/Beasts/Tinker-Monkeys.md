Clever scavengers that live on ruins, caverns and trees. Their name is actually something of a misnomer - they're as likely to be a group of lemurs or apes as they are monkeys, as various related and dexterous species seem to develop a hankering for disassembly out in the ruins and wastes.

Tinker-monkeys are well-adapted to the ruins, and need very little from the windsailers they encounter other than entertainment.  If given the chance they will steal pieces of gear, gnaw through floats, ropes and rigging, pester animal companions and members of the
[[Lascar]] and disassemble weapons and equipment.

Certain tinker-monkey groups have keener minds than the average animal (possibly from artifact resonance), using the gear they steal and equipment they disassemble to construct original machines and sculptures.

Presence
Sight:
Limber bodies swinging through the trees.
Sound:
Chattering and soft hooting.

Why Do We Call Them Monkeys?: This particular group of monkeys aren't monkeys at all. Maybe they're lemurs, or some other kind of vaguely simian beast. Maybe they're squirrels, or frogs, or something else entirely.
