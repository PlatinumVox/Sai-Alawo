In Nephlim culture, Rams are associated with homosexuality, since gay sheep are more common than you’d think. in real life, not just a worldbuilding thing. (About 10% of Rams refuse to mate with Ewes, prefering other Rams)

Buttons or jewelry made of ram’s horns can be a subtle indicator of sexuality. the cyclamen flower is associated more specifically with lesbians due to their being the favored flower of the somewhat mythologized soldier [[Emelin]], eventually evolving to an association with hares since the flower’s petals resemble their ears. however, some lesbians still prefer the ram iconography. same-sex marriages are colloquially known as ram weddings, even though the couple in question might be straight.

(just as gay people may end up in a political [[Marriage]] with the opposite sex, if you’re not the first son (/daughter where relevant) you may end up in a gay [[Marriage]] in order to strengthen bonds with another family while preventing you from having legal heirs that could enable you to challenge your older brother(s).)

in Kaltoran, as red is associated with blood, life, and childbirth; blue, as its opposite, can be used to indicate homosexuality or someone who is averse to marrying having children. plenty of straight people wear blue, but it’s used as a euphemism, and in plays the use of blue for character’s costumes is very deliberate.
