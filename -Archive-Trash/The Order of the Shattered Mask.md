The Order of the Shattered Mask are the self-proclaimed heroes of Alawo and hunters of Vilera. They travel from town to town keeping an eye out for the creatures, as well as hunting them down when found. Believers in their cause point to the number of the creatures members of the Order _have_ managed to kill, and the threat that unchecked Vilera cause. Detractors call them bloodthirsty fools that pounce on anyone even slightly unusual, and point to the corpses of non-Vilera that often follow in their wake.
