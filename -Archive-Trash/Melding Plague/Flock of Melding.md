There are disease-proof, survivor mutants that treat diseases of all kinds including the dreaded meld. The children that are separated into different specialties after training, as follows:

Trainees are known as **Shrikes** until they are recognized by their master as knowledgeable enough to practice on their own.

**Crows**- Traditional doctors, are trained to treat large amounts of patients at once. Specialize in treating non-melding ailments of the common folk and prevent spread with the help of vultures. Are generally better at triage than other plague doctors.

**Owls**- Specialize in treating melding illnesses. The owls are who you call when the whole town has been infected.

**Eagles**- better at long-term treatment plans for individuals rather than huge outbreaks. Have sweets on hand at all times for bratty nobles. They will often be seen along side Hermetics for personal treatments.

**Vultures**- Ensures that a disease, doesnâ€™t spread by any means possible, quarantine enforcers.

**Bird Houses** are specialty facilities where-in orphans are voluntarily recruited to be infected with a minor version of the [[Melding Plague]]. This plague infection allows them to have immunity to most strains of the plague and administer treatment to sufferers of the plague.

**Rising of the Flock**

	With the arising of the melding plague in the very early 60th century an organization was quickly founded after the first major infection. After this infection was quelled 46 years later the Bird House quickly became complacent, eventually causing the arrival of the second wave around 65 years later which ripped through the continent mercilessly and still does in the present day.

**Plight of the Meld**

	Upon completion of their training Shrikes will be voluntarily infected with the plague upon completion of rigorous fitness and health examinations. This is often a stressful time for the master as their pupil that they have trained for around one to three years may be lost to the meld. Upon passing through to the other side, in an often heavily disfigured state, shrikes, depending on their specific training house are granted their teacher hood and are able to practice freely with minor reviews and supervision by head masters. Upon enough years of practice the associate masters can gain their full master hood and take on a Shrike of their own.

Shrikes that are infected with the [[Melding Plague]] have a highly shortened life span of only 40 years, less lethal strain immedately but lessens their overall lifespan.

**Orphan to Shrike**
The first major task of a Shrike is to choose which **House** to enter, choosing a specific house will determine how the Shrike will practice in the future and what master they will be put under.
