Hovercycles (a.k.a. hoverbikes) are a form of personal transport. At least some of them possess a reactor that can overload, destroying the bike. 

The vehicle has the basic configuration of a motorcycle, but does not have any wheels. When stationary, it usually rests on four landing struts. While in motion, it normally flies above the ground. They operate via Holson Lazzari technology while forward thrust is provided by the main engine in the rear.
