**Alpha Simulacra**
Alpha simulacra, is a digitised version of a scanned human mind, perfectly replicating its brain structure. It was fully capable of remembering past experiences, learning, adapting, and was fully self-aware.

**Beta Simulacra**
Beta simulacra, sophisticated computer programs designed to mimic a person in appearance, mannerisms, and thought-patterns. While capable of successfully impersonating a human mind down to their most minute idiosyncrasies, they were not in fact self-aware -- they were just near-perfect imitations of life. As such, they enjoyed no legal rights or protections.

**Delta Simulacra**
Delta simulacra, used for countless tasks where precision -- but never creativity -- was required, they excelled at everything from piloting ships along routine routes to conducting customs interviews. Different delta-level personas may or may not be capable of simulating consciousness, but they were never actually self-aware.
