**Economy** 
The Kaltoran economy is based on reciprocity rather than money. Items are traded directly for other items or for promises and favours. There is a general understanding that the exact value of the trade is unimportant; all that matters is that both parties in the trade feel that they have not been cheated.

International trade is primarily done through barter or a third party such as the Rafan Trade Company, which makes trading with the Nephilim especially difficult as credits are not seen to have much value.

**Bazaars**
Kaltorans tend to conduct their trade at open markets of stalls
with posted goods for barter and goods accepted in trade. In this way
buyers can go stall to stall to find a barter match. If no single vendor
has the desired item, a complex chain of trades will eventually result
in the needed trade. Food and munitions are generally accepted for
trade; however, the amount needed to barter for a highly valued item
would be considerable and inconvenient to transport.

**Favours and Promises**
Sometimes an item is traded not for another item but for a favour or
a promise that an item will eventually be produced. These promises
and favours are not formal or official, but Kaltoran merchants often
keep ledgers to track everyone who owes favours and promises.

**Mining**
The Kaltorans are talented and experienced miners, and they have
made mining a cornerstone of their economy. Their settlements
and cities tend to be vast excavations, which has allowed them to
develop this unique expertise. Because they founded their cities on
Kardash underground, there has always been significant amount of
mining equipment available to them.
