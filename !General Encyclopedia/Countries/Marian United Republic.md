**Elders**
The Kaltorans have no centralized government and are instead organized around large family groupings. Each family is led by a senior member, often referred to as the Elder. A group of Elders from the most prominent families meet on a regular basis to discuss political matters for the betterment of their city or settlement. These meetings, simply called Gatherings, are more like informal dinners with talking points than they are a government. Each family in a Gathering is a free and independent entity but is accountable to the whole through reputation rather than law.

Each family has their own method for choosing their Elder. Most families choose the oldest capable leader, whereas some Elders are appointed by the previous one. Each Elder seeks the consensus of the family, and the power of their leadership is a reflection of their reputation as a good leader.

**Reputation**
Much of what gives an individual or a family higher status than another is their reputation. Kaltorans who are trustworthy, just, strong, bold, and kind are likely to enjoy greater status, as are those who have a record of good and adventurous deeds. However, Kaltorans
seen as callous, greedy, or selfish are not well liked and often disowned by their families. The genetic memories which Kaltorans experience reinforce this status; children remember the deeds of their parents, both good and bad.

**Mining**
The Kaltorans are talented and experienced miners, and they have made mining a cornerstone of their economy. Their settlements and cities tend to be vast excavations of ancient structures, which has allowed them to develop this unique expertise. Because they founded their cities on Kardash underground, there has always been significant amount of
mining equipment available to them.
	**Conflict with the Nephilim**
	Kaltorans and the Nephilim commonly find themselves at odds in regards to mining within the  Alboli continent. While the Kaltorans have an abundance of skills and equipment, they do not share the Nephilim’s passion for profit and business. The Nephilim is keen to gain access to Kaltoran equipment and skills, but most Kaltorans find the Nephilim’s financial ambitions misguided at best

**Enforcement and Provision**
The Kaltorans do not have a true legal system; instead, each Kaltoran has a personal responsibility to care for those in need and enforce justice as they see fit. This justice is not formally codified or explained; it is up to the conscience of the individual. As a result,
most Kaltorans overlook minor misdemeanors and deal out very harsh punishments to serious crimes.
	**Unclear Legality**
	Other ancestors who visit Kaltoran settlements sometimes find that the lack of clear legal distinctions lead to a variety of difficulties. However, there is some accountability when families disagree over the fairness of a situation: the Elders of both families will meet and come to an arrangement. In the interest of peace, this often leads to Elders punishing their own family members for dealing out justice too harshly.
	**Always Armed**
	Nearly all Kaltorans carry a weapon at all times, partly because there is a lack of any official law enforcement and partly because of their violent past. Weapons are carried like a badge of honour, and many weapons are family heirlooms. It is common for a Kaltoran to get their first (low-powered) gun at age eight.
