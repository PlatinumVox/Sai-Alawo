**Capital City**

The Karlden Clan and the Clan of Crete became collectively known as the Mercantile Clans, and thanks to the incredible wealth they were bringing in, Biyaha grew increasingly more urbanized. 

However, it also grew more corrupt as the Mercantile Clans used their power and influence in order to further and protect their own interests. As they undermined the meritocratic system that had served Biyaha so well, the Kingdomâ€™s leadership grew weak, thus ending its golden age.

The Mercantile Clans launched their greatest undertaking in the [] century. After acquiring the Sinai Peninsula from the Nephilim States, in large due part to the sizeable Kaltoran and Nephilim population who had settled there following the Nephilim-Alboli War, they invested an enormous amount of resources and manpower to construct a flat, 14.6 meter wide paved road connecting the Chasm Gap with the Cobalt Bay intended to serve as a highway for trade goods.

**Clan Felan**
One of the local Nephilim clans, Clan Felan, was given control of Sinai. Subordinate to the other Mercantile Clans, Clan Felan nevertheless received everything they needed to build a massive fleet of cargo vehicles and merchant ships so that they could transport trade goods in bulk from the east to the coast of the Cobalt Bay into what would eventually become Rafanese Territories.

However, the ambitious plans of the Mercantile Clans had to be put on hold when the First Melding Plague began to spread like wildfire throughout [[Alawo]]. Looking for an easy scapegoat many Nephilim politicians would blame the Kalotrans for its rise as they were reemerging from the sea. Many Kaltorans inside of the Emirates were killed by mobs of Nephilim looking for scapegoats, the Mercantile Clans benefited immensely from the calamity.

**Aggressive Expansion**
All of their rivals, such as the newly forming [[Marian United Republic]] and the [[Dahani Triumvirate]], were significantly weakened by the First [[Melding Plague]] , and the Mercantile Clans took the opportunity to fill the void left by them expanding deeply into Dahani Territory splitting the Triumvirate in two eventually colonizing around [[Chasm Gap]]. Once the plague had passed, the Mercantile Clans of Biyaha were unquestionably the dominant trading power in the known world as a link from Mari barter-trading to Nephilim chip. They even managed to persuade the Nephilim council to grant them a monopoly on all maritime trade east of the [[Chasm Gap]].

**Colonial Gap**
The Clan of Sinai purchased a substantial plot of land from the [[Marian United Republic]] on the norther most coast of [[Chasm Gap]] from the [[Elder Council]] of Mai. And in [] they established a Biyaha colony there, thus setting the stage for a new era of trade and colonialism. Clan Felan would later ask the sovereign and commanders of Biyahian to provide them with armies to help protect and expand their holdings in the west. In exchange for this, the Clan of Sinai would found well-maintained colonies for their combat veterans in the eastern territories. This arrangement proved highly successful, and it allowed Clan Felan to expand not just throughout Northern Alawo, but further east, deep into the [[Cobalt Jungle]]s. By the mid- century, Biyaha ruled over the vast majority of the Northern [[Dahani Triumvirate]], [[Shimmering Sea]] Islands, and [[Glass Bay]].
