**Blood**
An individual may possess one of several different colors of blood spread across the color spectrum of blues. This is known as the Hemocaste, and it is the basis of a stratified societal caste system that assigns social status based on blood purity; low-ranking Nephilim are regarded as "lowbloods", whereas high-ranking Neph are referred to as "purebloods". Different blood castes also have differing biological aspects such as purer bloods having thicker bodies and features, lower castes often thinner features when compared to higher castes.

 At the intersection of pure and low bloods are the more "mixed bloods" who have large portions of the ancient pure blood caste but some more low blood in them.

 Any other ancestries are welcome but are often shuttered as low bloods from anything more than lower caste labor.
 
 **Rulers**
 Often those in the triumvirate are very young in age, while their older family members are phased out for being to old in age. While some believe that the triumvirate rules of the three provinces are not the true rulers, the three have equal but strong regulatory powers although they are often influenced by the older sections of their family who have past their ruling prime. 

 As for individual city rulers, they are often those who have mixed blood lines but are still respected as efficient cogs in the burgeoning industrial machine of Dahani Triumvirate. 

With the burgeoning industrial powers of the nation, the triumvirate directs its powers into large swaths of floating technology quickly directing this into lifting whole suburbs of cities into the sky above the lower castes connected by anchored hooks.
