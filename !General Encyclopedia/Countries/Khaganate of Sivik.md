**Tribunal Law**
The Alboli deals with all internal legal matters by military tribunal. Any officer or soldier who has committed a crime is brought before three high-ranking officers, who determine guilt and punishment. At times they order an investigation and make their decision based on its findings.

Punishments can be quite harsh: death for treachery, and public whipping for negligence. When many Alboli deserted to become mercenaries, they were exiled as punishment. If an Exsilia is caught on [[Hantin]] , the punishment is death. Exsilia  are often under the authority of Nephilim regulatory law as they are no longer considered part of the Alboli army. deals with all internal legal matters by military tribunal.

**Lady Vengeance; Khangnate Athene Kosta**
Athene, a major Khan under the ruling Khaganate regards the Exsilia as misguided; she understand the reasons for their departure, but she does not accept disloyalty. She has offered a pardon to any Exsilia who wishes to enlist in her Auxilia; however, Exsilia who have outright refused this generous offer or have attacked the Alboli are branded traitors and deserters.

**Planned Economy**
The officers of the Alboli manage their economy with military precision and mindset, and this has several **important implications:**
First, all basic supplies are distributed according to need. Quartermasters of the Alboli create a list of requirements for their living needs and operation; in turn this list is given to the Interior Branch, which ensures that all needs are met.
	**Exodus in Surplus**
	In recent times, large numbers of Alboli have departed to the White Gum Wastes , and the Nephilim has provided the Alboli with significant resources. All this has led to surpluses for the first time in centuries. The families of Auxilia are first to receive these surpluses as a reward for their valuable service to the Alboli economy.
