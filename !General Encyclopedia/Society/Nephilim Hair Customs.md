Much like Alboli and Kaltorans, Nephilim have many rules and customs in regards to their hair. Unlike Kaltorans who believe in the act of cutting their hair as shameful or Alboli who only mmaintain their hair until battle (an Albolian answer to “throwing down the gauntlet”), a Nephilim will cut or restyle their hair at certain major turning points during their lifetime, such as (but not limited to) reaching adulthood, [[Marriage]], a major victory or loss on the battlefield, and death.

Age/Occasion
**Youth** No beads. No Braiding. Usually worn lose or in a ponytail. Ribbions are popular with the kids.

**Adulthood** Braiding is allowed. Hair is very long if unmarried. Beads can be earned. Improper to wear hair entirely loose at this point in life.

**Old Age** Worn up in buns if long enough. If short, ribbons, horsehair, wool, etc will be used to emulate longer hair.

**[[Marriage]]** A newly married Nephilim will cut off their hair in the back to signify commitment. Polycules are disallowed from divorce until all parties have regrown their hair to their shoulders (usually about 2-3 months). A married Neph will cap their braids with metals and ceramics.

**Victory** This celebratory hair style is characterised by excessive decoration and braiding, to be worn for 2 weeks upon which the Nephilim will add another bead to their everyday attire.

**Battlefield Loss/ Death of a Loved One** Signified by an entirely clipped head of hair, when a major loss is suffered in life, it is unlucky not to pay it due respect by giving up some of your pride for one that you love.
 
**Death and Burial** A Nephilim that is passing over into the after must have their hair covered in a veil so that no beasts or demonic beings on the journey may see their life experiences. They are said to be allowed to uncover themselves before the Ancients in the afterlife for judgement.
