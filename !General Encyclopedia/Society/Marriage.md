Variable, given the size and diversity of the Continent (and wealth considerations), but things they tend to have in common:

In cities and towns, there are (largely ceremonial) processions of one spouse from their family's home to the home of their their partner's family. In large and/or wealthy extended families where people don't all live in the same home, the Family Home usually means the home of whoever is considered head of the family, or wherever is considered to be the "original" family home.

  People clear the streets when they see wedding processions (the way drivers often stop for funeral processions in our world) and often yell well wishes. Depending on the circumstances things like rice, barley, the dried leaves of fragrant herbs, or flower petals will be thrown in the air along the parade route, and it's seen as good luck if a grain or a petal falls on you, with the type of luck depending on the item (grain = prosperity, herb = good health, flower petal = love and friendship).

  There is an emphasis on family clans to the extent that it's not seen as a joining of families as much as it is one person joining another person's family. They still have the expected sympathies for and obligations to their family of origin (especially around mourning rituals), but this framework is underlined in a lot of wedding symbolism. Which spouse does the aforementioned procession (thereby announcing their union with the other person's family) isn't determined by gender, but instead by who is joining the other family.

  The giving of gifts is extremely important. The person who is leaving home will recieve gifts from their betrothed that aren't opened until the day before the wedding, at breakfast (note: the day before a wedding also has a lot of traditions too). These gifts will lead the procession to their new home for all to see, and among the wealthy are symbolic home objects (ie a golden ladle, a heavily embroidered "rice sack" that's made of silk) rather than practical ones. Behind the person will travel their gifts for their new spouse and their family, which include a mix of symbolic and practical items. One of the most important ones is a chest of linens, which will mostly be practical. There is a tradition of the top item of the linen pile being a set of matching robes for the newlyweds, entirely of silk for the wealthy. Other people will save to afford a bit of silk to sew onto their wool or linen robes, whether as embellishment or even just a tiny scrap on one of the cuffs.

The actual ceremony itself takes place inside after the procession arrives. The person joining the family is not supposed to set foot on the grounds of their new family's home until everything is complete, so there are strategically placed woven mats. The mats first lead to a table near the door, where papers are signed/marked in a similar way that we do today. The mats then lead to the family's ancestral altar, where the couple kneel. Vows are spoken, the "groom" presents the "bride" to their ancestors for approval, and then candles or incense are lit. When they rise, they are considered married and then they step off the mats and onto the floor together. Then it's time to party!

Individual families have their own traditions, including things that are unique about how they adapt the common traditions, but that's considered part of getting to know your new family, and meant to encourage people to reflect fondly on their own weddings as they witness the same quirks at future ceremonies. There are also small gifts exchanged on the wedding night between the couple, and these are meant to be personally meaningful. In the morning they are supposed to wear, carry, or otherwise display those gifts at the family breakfast, so most people go with jewelry or accessories decorated with a favorite color, animal, or emblem.
