As opposed to the scientific method and analysis of the Tech-Speakers, Resonants take a more holistic view on the artifacts they interact with. Using musical, speaking, and sound design talents, Resonants manage to vibrate artifacts and their frequency in order to produce anomalous effects. These effects often do not match up with the effects that Techspeakers are able to produce, although they sometimes do. Techspeakers tend to insist that this difference is a matter of "using it wrong", while Resonants tend to take on the view that the Techspeakers' results are inferior, due to a lack of resonance with the Soul of the artifact.


Resonant Talents:
Song-The ability to sing in a way that produces artifact effects. 
Speech-The ability to resonate your speaking voice in a way that produces artifact effects. Foley(Placeholder name)- The ability to use your environment to produce sounds that causes artifact effects. 
Emotional-The ability to manipulate one's own emotions in a way that produces an emotional resonance with artifacts that produces anomalous results.

 Due to the skills that Resonants need in order to perform their Talents, most of them can apply these skills in other areas-a Song Resonant is often a bard, rockstar, or other form of performer, a Speaker Resonant is often an actor or other kind of orator, an Emotional Resonant is usually a social chameleon, etc.
    
Speaker Resonants that engage in debate often use their artifacts to back up their argument for dramatic effect, occasionally resulting in a clash of philosophies that resembles a mystical duel as much as a rational discussion of ideas.
