As a hunter your role is to provide food and materials for the crew, usually in the form of
animals parts. Some hunters prefer more complex prey, styling themselves as bounty
hunters and roving the waves looking to bring down bounties for payment. Either way,
stealthy movement and hidden snares often pay dividends.
Hunts and Honour
Several well-recognised groups in the wildsea base their culture and philosophies
around hunting, and almost every settlement has citizens engaged in the practice.
There's an undeniable thrill to the activity, the snapping-shut of a trap or the spray
of blood from a piercing arrow, but despite this hunters are typically characterised as
reclusive, sombre folk.
It might be that the waves demand a certain level of respect - when you're in among
the branches, in a world designed to aid your quarry and stymie you at every turn you
quickly learn your place in the grand scheme of things.
Bounties and Payment
When you've got the skills to track down something that doesn't want to be found, it's
natural that at some point you'll be asked to track down someone that doesn't want to be
found. Not all hunters are willing to take the moral step required to target members of
other bloodlines, partly due to the extra risk involved and partly the lax attitude toward
law that pervades across the wider waves.
