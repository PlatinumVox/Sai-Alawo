Part scholar, part explorer, horizoneers make it their business to learn as much about
the crumbling ruins as possible. They root out its secrets, study its beasts and integrate almost seamlessly into its manifold cultures, mimicking even the most novel customs with ease.
Many horizoneers also take on the task of disseminating this gathered knowledge as effectively as possible; sometimes through the medium of songs and poems, sometimes
lectures and manuscripts. If there’s one thing every horizoneer has in common, it’s a
way with words.

**Not All Blood and Guts**

One of the defining elements of the horizoneer is a push toward peace and understanding rather than conflict and bloodshed. Even dire situations can often be defused by a few well-chosen words, and when you get down to it even the wildest of beasts can be turned from their immediate predations with enough skill. This doesn't mean that a horizoneer is inherently a pacifist - a well-swung lute can leave a bruise as reliably as a stave - but it does mean that crews with a horizoneer are less likely to treat combat as the go-to option when presented with hostility.

**Bardic Tradition**

While not every horizoneer carries an instrument, it's rare to find one without at
least some musical inclination. Songs and poems have a way of sticking in the mind, a
memory aid for the horizoneer themselves and something to help them draw crowds
and create a sense of community in new places. It's not uncommon to visit a distant port
and hear the strains of a familiar tune, evidence that a horizoneer has passed through at
some point and left their musical mark on the place.
