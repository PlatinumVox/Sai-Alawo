**Herbalists who connect you to the deeper mysteries of the ruined world with but a sip.**

Herbs and water are nourishing to the body; concoctions feed the spirit. A steep is the
hand by which concoctions are mixed. A Steep will often combine the skills of a traditional  doctor, a therapist, a scholar of research alongside a bit of herbal care.

Portside Steeps train for long years in what passes, in the post-meld world, for the
halls of academia. But ship-posted Steeps have to learn on the job.

**It Won't Be Pretty**
The Alawoian continent is a world of aches and scars, imperfect healing and old breaks. Steeps do what they can to stem the tide of spilled blood and broken bones, but they're often left working with unexact materials and under trying circumstances. If you take a serious injury, there's a good chances it's going to leave a scar.
Luckily for the person, the lingering sight of past trauma has little to do with the
standard of care received. Those living with scars tend more to focus on the 'living' part
than the 'scar' part, and that first part is almost always thanks to the ministrations of an
overworked Steep.

**Medical Companion** 
High class and trained Steeps will often be seen alongside [[Pangola]]s, making a Pangola a deeply entrenched symbol of medical care. Steeps will often grow medicinal plants on their backs to help in the well being of their patients. More shady individuals will often traffic Pangolas in use for more illicit drug growing properties.
