**History**
In remembrance of their ancestors, Kaltorans partake in a march to the sea once a decade. In remembrance of the war a millenia ago which formed their ancestral memory bond from the Juggler Sea, the Kaltorans march in one unending line with families side by side, separating into different strata once married. This night is only partaken by the civilian populace.

**Activities**
Families of all Kaltoran respects begin a march to the sea that ends on the day of the new year. This is often seen as a formative time in kaltoran youth. Nine months later the birth rate is often sparked in lieu of the celebrations.

Descendants of the Juggler sea celebrate the holiday by dressing in bright red and other sunrise hues and by keeping one eye covered until the next dawn viewing the Western Ocean of the Marian Republic . Non-Kaltorans sympathetic to the practice had the custom to wink at celebrants with whom they established eye contact. This practice often resulted in lasting friendships.

**Covering of the Eye**
The covered eye in this ceremony specifically causes the Kaltorans to literally see a past march that was done by their ancestors, children touching the sea will often get their first visions upon the first march home.
