Alboli Reproduction
**Alboli**, like some reptiles, develop based on the temperature of the caves they are raised in. Alboli in cooler caves grow up to be male; Alboli in warmer caves grow up to be female. Female alboli are associated with the fire of the communal bonfires and the power of creation. Alboli are not, however, sexually dimorphic, and asking whether an alboli is “really” male or female is deeply personal and offensive, since an individual’s ability to become pregnant is invariably none of the asker’s business. It is common for alboli to reject any affiliation with gender entirely, but those that care for that sort of thing have some very elaborate and colorful genders.
