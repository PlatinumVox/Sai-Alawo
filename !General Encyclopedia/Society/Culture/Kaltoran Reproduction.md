Kaltoran Reproduction
**Kaltoran** are technically all asexual, and reproduce by self-fertilization. Kaltoran are long-lived enough that they do not quickly accrue harmful mutations and deleterious effects from this. However, they have another mechanism to mitigate the harmful effects of self-fertilization: they regularly engage in horizontal gene transfer with the endosymbiotic algae that live in their skin! These algae act as a reservoir for genetic diversity. Some Kaltoran also have similar exchanges with the parasitic plants that grow on their headsâ€¦yeah no, those are not flower crowns. Altnough Kaltorans are asexual, they are decendant from Nephilim, which allows for casual sexual activity to occur even if it is not for the explicit purpose of reproduction.
