A steam locomotive is a rail vehicle that provides the force to move itself and other vehicles by means of the expansion of steam. After the [[Melding Plague]] caused the collapse of electrical vehicular infrastructure, train carts that were originally pulled by electrical locomotion where remade into massive steam engines that could provide basic power outputs to devices in the train cars.
