Boots that allow the user to defy gravity and propel themselves in the air, hover, or fly. Each boot weighs about 9 kilos and have three parallel latches around the boot that lock the legs in. Also called Hooves by lower bloods and castes.

Pure bloods will often opt for a more expensive personal transport that can hover themselves personally and with enough strength multiple people.
