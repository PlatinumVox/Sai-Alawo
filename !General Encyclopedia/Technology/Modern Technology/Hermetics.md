After the onset of the  [[Melding Plague]] various individuals sought to remain implanted with nanotechnologies, for either quality-of-life or life-extension reasons. To that end, the wealthy could purchase Palanquins. Hermetically-sealed, mobile environments, they allowed their users to travel in plague ridden areas without fear of infection.

While used by the upper echelons of post-plague  Breachport society, they also served as a means for habitat dwellers to come and go from the surface without exposing themselves or their clean orbiting environments to any risk of infection.

The users/inhabitants of palanquins were referred to as "hermetics"
