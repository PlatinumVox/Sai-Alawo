The Ancients ran into worms first– in nature, these oversized razor clams. Worms (like Alboli, Kaltorans, Nephilim, and every other Modified creature) aren’t completely artificial. They’re an existing species that was crudely manipulated and conditioned to serve a role in the maintenance ecosystem.  Worms are actually weird shellfish that have been “shucked” and stuffed in robotic suits.  While their suits don’t age, the worm bodies do, and they need to be replaced every century or two. There are ancient facilities dedicated to making more worms.  However, unlike humanoids, worms can’t reproduce on their own. They’re essentially shellfish, designed to scatter genetic material into the tides. As a shell-less amalgam in a robot suit, they’re totally unable to do this.

**Diet**
While their favorite snack is plankton, algae, and other microorganisms present in water, a good substitute is sugar water. They can actually eat a variety of things, provided they’re blended and diluted with lots of water. Food generally has to be poured down a special port on the suit somewhere.

**Pilots of an Ancient World**
Originally designed to maintain the ecosystem and world of Alawo, worms continue their duty to this day and can be found in anything from;

-Massive Alboli walking cities, which were orignally ice management devices

-Smaller carapaces for maintainence of major ancient facilities

-Communication stations floating in Pattern Juggler sea(s)

-Under water reef management devices

-Ring support networks to maintain terraforming networks
