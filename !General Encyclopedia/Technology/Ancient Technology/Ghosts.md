Ghost people are the remnants of ancient brain uploaded humans. Originally they served as advisors and preservers of culture for ancient leaders, but many centuries worth of hardware errors have eroded their minds to the point that most of them do little else than wander aimlessly while parroting apparently meaningless phrases. 

In outdoor locations, ghost people are almost universally accompanied by ring shaped drones that project their appearances and allow them to see and speak. Acknowledging their presence is considered to bring bad luck. 

However a small number of scholars and religious leaders have been known to record and study the phrases uttered by ghosts, hoping that theyâ€™ll uncover lost wisdom.![[Ghosts.png]]
