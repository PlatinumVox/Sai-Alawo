The Amber Gleaners are a loose network of scholars, explorers, delves, and other travelers who share with each other knowledge of the routes and locations they discover, enhancing the knowledge of everyone who joins and contributes to the organization. The organization also runs a small trading concern, the Amber Traders, that seeks to finance and support the group through the sale of oddities, parts, and artifacts salvaged from distant locations. 

The Amber Gleaners attempt to portray themselves as brave, stalwart searchers into the unknown, more interested in scholarship than profit. They are largely successful in this portrayal, despite tensions that the Amber Traders sometimes introduce—trading makes them vulnerable to accusations of being more interested in profit than knowledge.

The Amber Gleaners may be scholarly, but the explorers who make up its ranks are hardy searchers of the unknown. They don’t blanch at entering locations locals claim to be deadly dangerous, even when stories suggest especially gruesome ends to trespassers. In fact, the Gleaners have a variety of sayings for when they insist on entering a place that’s especially dangerous. For instance, they might say, “Let’s get to it, my teeth are scratching the floor,” which is a way of demonstrating how eager they are to be on their way even in the face of danger.

Basic Amber Gleaner field stations are
sprinkled across the Pangea of main Alawo and even a little ways into the Alboli territory of the White Gum wastes. 

Their locations are noted on secret maps written with symbols known only to the Gleaners. Basic field stations contain only a locked container stuffed with extra rations and water, a couple of explorer’s packs, and a thick journal or two in which all previous Gleaners who’ve accessed the station note their arrival, what they’ve taken from or left in the station, and one or two details briefly describing what they’ve recently discovered. Basic field stations are resupplied, when possible, by members on probation or those who seek entry and must prove their dedication first. 

Larger Amber Gleaner field stations, of which there are only five or six, are usually just single rooms in larger civic structures. These chambers are given over to many books and scrolls penned with knowledge about nearby locations, fauna, and rumors that would interest an explorer. These stations are usually staffed by one or two elderly explorers who insist on a story or two before allowing others to access their lore. Outsiders may also gain entry but only under strict supervision and after having paid a hefty price in the form of one locus (or equivalent) per day of access. (These Locus are stored until an Amber Trader convoy moves through and collects them for later sale.)

The Amber Gleaners’ headquarters is located in the [[Dahani Triumvirate]] in the city of [[Andictoria]] in a grand building called the Amber Lodge.

**Badge of Membership:** An oddity that (usually)
points to north
**Member Benefits:** Membership provides several benefits to the committed, including access to Amber Gleaner field stations, access to records of other Gleaners as well as the Amber Lodge’s Collections, contacts among other excavators, and regular leads about sites of interest that no one else has explored yet. Sometimes the Amber Gleaners will mount expeditions or fund explorations if a member—or prospective member—makes a strong-enough case. Finally, a member is trained in all tasks related to navigation and finding one’s way in an unfamiliar location.
