description of how being a Wax Artificer works. also link to the Wax-Light Order's page, but idk how to do that.

***Washing***
No two artifacts are alike. One can only make educated guesses about their properties by looking at them. Figuring out what an artifact DOES takes patience and careful documentation. Only when its characteristics have been thoroughly explored is the artifact safe to be used.

**Exploration**
First, the artificer gives the artifact an exploratory wash of electrical energy. They look for “weak” points, where energy can be more accurately applied to the artifact. Next, they begin to carefully explore these inputs gently prodding them with energy - what do they do? what effects do the have? Each node gets marked with a non conductive ceramic tack and tag. Each one has its properties recorded. If there is something exceptional about the artifact, it might be marked down for closer research. But most of the time the artifact will just go into storage.

A majority of artifacts are junk, with properties that are too weak or too esoteric to be useful. The International Federated Archives are full of artifacts that produce a little light, a little heat or give the user a strangle muddled feeling in the pit of their stomach. These will sit in storage, be ground down for reforging into more useful tech, or sold on the market as scrap.

Most useful artifacts have strong, specific effects. They produce a clear feeling - satisfaction, fear, anxiety. They manifest a useful physical phenomena, like a cutting torch. These will be issued to The International Federated Archives lead Artificers, sold, or donated to major world powers as a gesture of good will.

**Wash with Energy**
Part of using artifacts is using your body as a conduit. But there’s another component to it. It’s also _making the querry;_ correctly requesting the energy you need within bioelectric energies in the user's body. While channeling happens in the hands, querying happens in the head.

Artificers do this implicitly– it’s a feeling, not a defined process. A mental groove you fall into. An intuition that you can practice, but not articulate. An Artificers holds an artifact they want to power. They concentrate. Their head tingles– a shivery, electric feeling that starts on their scalp and travels down their spines. They sense what the artifact wants– what kind of energy it needs to work and the frequency at which they need to be given power. They focus on this for as long as it takes for it to become clear and well defined. When it is, they take a deep breath.

And then– implicitly– they reach DOWN, within themselves. And they make the request for energy. The body will respond almost instantly. This response travels all the way up from the Artificers’ feet and up their spines to their querry. Their electro-capacitive gear will swell as they accept the energy carefully evaluating how it feels, ensuring that it’s _correct_. And once the artificers is satisfied, they release it through their hands, and into the artifact.

New artificers have to think about it every time, but experienced artificers just… do. It gets automatic.  An artificer can power a small artifact almost without thinking, with the same amount of effort it might take to flip a light switch.

**Dangers of Washing**
Most of the time, what you put into an artifact is proportional to what you get out of it. The artifact is taking the energy being pumped into it and… transforming it in some way. Less energy = less potential for things to go wrong.

When artificers catalogue artifacts, they’re metaphorically dipping their toe in the water— just getting a sense of what’s going on. And if the water is too hot, or too cold, it’s only going to affect the toe. If manipulating the artifact in that way might damage it, you‘re only going to damage it a little bit. If it’s dangerous to you, the risk is going to be comparatively small. So that’s how it’s supposed to work. But the the greater risk, which is present whenever you’re working with artifacts, big or small is “falling into the water.” Losing control of the artifact— and allowing it to suck energy through you until your blood boils.

It’s something that every artificer thinks about, but it’s a risk that’s much more present when you’re working with powerful artifacts that take lots of energy to manipulate. For that to happen during basic cataloguing would take a mixture of negligence and inexperience that would be unlikely to happen in any reputable organization.
