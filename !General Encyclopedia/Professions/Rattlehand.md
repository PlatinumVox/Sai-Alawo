**Everything breaks eventually, but most of it can be repaired**

Hull-iron rusts. Light bulbs fade. Engines cough and struggle. In a world of salvage and
barter, nothing lasts foreverâ€¦ unless you have a good rattlehand on your side.

A rattlehand is somewhere between an engineer, a blacksmith and an artist, able to use
the scrap of the ruins to repair, reinforce and create. Many rattlehands excel in crafting
new and unique gear to sell to the people, perfectly suited to the troubles they face.

**A Second-Hand World**
The first thing almost every rattlehand learns is how to make the best of a bad situation;
relying on imprecise tools, twisted salvage and broken machinery to ply their trade. The
lack of wide-scale mining and ore processing makes metal shortage an unfortunate
reality, so those that balk at the idea of repurposing the same wreckage for the twentieth
time often turn to wood or bone as a stand-in.
