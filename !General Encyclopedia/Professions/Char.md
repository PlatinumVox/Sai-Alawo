Whenever you smell something delectable thereâ€™s a good chance that a char is behind
it. Chars are somewhere between chef and survivalist, with a dash of healer and vintner thrown in for good measure. Many chars lack formal training, instead putting in years of trial and error until they come up with a set of flavour combinations that suit their unique tastes. A precious few do manage to study under one of the old culinary masters, spreading their unique recipes across the lands.

Cookfires are, as you might expect, a rarity in the [[ruins]]... But meat needs to
fry and tea needs to brew, so chars have found various ways around this limitation. Some eschew heat altogether, focusing on salts and pickling, spice-rubs and sun- drying. Others treat the engine room as an extension of the galley, using engine heat and pressure in place of actual flame. The most adventurous experiment with trained glowbugs, chemical hot-plates and [[Washing]].
