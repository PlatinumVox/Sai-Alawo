Whether it’s across crumbling ruins, deep within city streets or the rolling deck of a ship mid-combat, most corsairs are constantly on the move. While there are those that weigh
themselves down with salvage-hammered armour and heavier weapons these are in the extreme minority - the constant threat of an unexpected tumble into their end is a
strong motivator for staying nimble.

Most corsairs follow the ancient wisdom that the best defence is a strong and punishing
offence. It’s not unusual for corsairs to switch between a mixture of esoteric fighting
styles and acrobatic feats to keep their foes off balance.
