##### **Ley Lines**
Ley Lines are important to all the ancestors. They are able to mysteriously power all relics. Despite the significance of the Ley Lines, very little is known about them, as their secrets died before their human creators did.

**Creation**
Ley Lines were created by humanity during an event referred to as the Reality Fracture. No one knows what caused it; some speculate that it was by design, others by accident.

**Nature**
The Ley Lines are tiny cracks or tears in the fabric of space-time; their exact nature is unknown. Although the cracks are microns thick and invisible to the naked eye, their lengths are measured in lightÂ years.

**Theories**
Many speculate that the Ley Lines are cracks between our dimension and another, which is bleeding its own natural laws into our own.

Others believe that the Ley Lines do not lead to another dimension at all, but are instead chains of densely packed energy particles which have been slowly dissipating for millennia.

There are some people on the fringes who believe the Ley Lines are gateways to a mystical afterlife or were created by a non-human being of immense power.

**Ley-Relic Energy**
What we do know is that the cracks leak energy particles known as Ley-Relic Energy, and this energy is used to generate a powerful force which allows for the power of Relics.
