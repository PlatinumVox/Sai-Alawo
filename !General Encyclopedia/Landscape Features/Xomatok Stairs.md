Astonishingly gorgeous mural work on staircases from Nephilim artist across Central Province, Dahani.

The works are explorations in the alteration of space focusing on color and its relationship with Nephilim kind.

This style of artistry has become common place in the often grey and lifeless cities of the Dahani Triumvirate.
