Glass Bay in the Alboli Far East. 
Those beautiful pebbles are bottle debris polished by the sea water. This place used to be a dump for old glass bottles from a local porcelain factory. Nature has corrected man's mistake, and created another piece of beauty.

**Presence**
**Sight:** Soft sunlight reflecting off of glass through soft snows.
**Sound:** The crunch of glass underfoot.
