The Zhao-Hutchinson Supermassive Reflector Array (ZHSRA), the construction of which began in the ■, was the culmination of decades of international cooperation to rebuild a world ravaged by pollution, collapsing world governments and ecological collapse. It’s primary short-term goal was to aid in the re-growth of the northern ice cap by redirecting sunlight away from the pole and redistributing it towards industrial zones to be used for power. Long-term it would be used as a vital stepping stone by the Ancients to a dream of space exploration that had for so long been postponed.

In the era of Ancient Collapse, ZHSRA had become vital for a planet now entering a complete ice age, to redirect sunlight towards Sai Alawo for bare survival of the descendant races of humanity.
