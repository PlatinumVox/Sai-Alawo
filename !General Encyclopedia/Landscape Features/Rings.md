### Waystone Rings

These Kilo-meter tall rings were probably once aligned long ago to enact and unknown purpose are not scattered haphazardly along the equator. Often carved and with designs or inscribed with messages in the ancients language, these rings continue to aid travelers and [[Lascar]]s to this day.

##### Rest for the Weary
When resting in the presence of a ring, you will often gain additional benefits from the innate ley-relic powers imbued within the rings themselves. Travelers along the Equator airway in [[Dirigible]]s will often set camp nearby a ring for safety as, oddly enough trees, plants and local wildlife seem to avoid these mysterious rings a majority of the time. That is, unless there is an enticing enough meal within.

##### Comforting Light
Much like other ruins around Alawo a  bioluminescence of Moteflies and [[Moteshrooms]] surrounds the area. As dusk falls, a number of small motes of light will often appear around the base of the Rings, providing a comforting presence and gentle illumination. These motes, which are believed to be relic based last from dusk until dawn and provide a dim light up to 30 meters from the rings.

**Presence**
**Sight:** Large rings that often dominate the horizon of central Alawo
**Sound:** Soft thump of metal and inner noises within.
