**Kaltoran Food**
	Kaltoran cuisine incorporates a lot of spices, orange rice, mutton, a tomato looking fruit with an pumpkin-like consistency called [[Kol]], a citrus fruit known as [[Denya]], ground vegetables, greens, fish and other seafood, and the meat of the [[Nil Nil]] meat antelope (tastes like venison). 

**Caro [[Nil Nil]]**

A staple meal would be Caro [[Nil Nil]], a meal served in a bowl with orange rice, slow-cooked [[Nil Nil]] meat, chopped and saut√©ed kol, a spicy sauce known as [[Cialua]], and a testy yogurt close to tzatziki called [[nin dac]]. Another common meal is [[sauk]], a meal of thin, pulled egg noodles covered in [[Cialua]], garnished with fish sauce (similar to that of Southeast Asia) dried garlic, and [[Denya]] juice. 

**Pastry**

A common pastry know as [[piye]] is made with rice flour, ground flower petal paste, and a sugary syrup. The rice dough is molded around the petal paste, then fried in oil. Once the dough expands into a circular shape, it is dipped into the syrup until fully coated.
