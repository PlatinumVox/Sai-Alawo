**Nephilim Food**

In the Nephilim cuisine they eat a lot of barley bread, [[Capral-Khaff]] dairy products, potatoes (mashed is very popular, but you'll also find fried and baked potatoes), and vegetables (fermented veggies probably being the most popular type of preparation). During summer, particularly during the [[Zyphine's Night]] Festival season, they eat star soup. 

**Star Soup**

[[Star soup]] is a milk or cream soup with vegetables and star shaped noodles. Sour star soup is a specific, very popular type of star soup which includes fermented vegetables. Pies are also very popular year round in the valley, both savory and sweet. A popular savory pie is mash pie, which is a pie filled with mashed potatoes and vegetables. 

**Dessert**

Dessert wise things like honey and berries  were not traditionally easily available (if at all) to the Nephilim, but tree fruits, chocolate, and sugar from sugar cane were available and so those feature heavily in Nephilim sweets. 

**Junk Food**

Junk food wise, onion chips are as popular if not more popular than potato chips, which are very popular, and the most popular soda pop brand ([Bebabu]) is a highly sugared soda with the flavors sugar cane, dragon fruit, mango, pineapple, kiwi, and wild berry/berry mix. 

**Don't Eat the Khaff**

The Nephilim don't eat much meat, but when they do, they generally eat either chicken or game, but never Khaff s. Eating [[Capral-Khaff]]  is so frowned upon that they even have an idiom "to eat the Khaff " that means to do something you really don't want to do out of desperation or after all other options have failed. (Khaff s are taboo for a similar reason dogs are taboo in many irl societies).

In substitution of meat and proteins, species of moths, butterflies, crickets and beetles are eaten, although they're less popular than other food groups. They're eaten whole.

**Pastry**

[[Elyruns]], pockets of fried dough with caviar and Khaff  cheese inside. Often sold of the streets of major cities. Sweet versions often include chocolate, savory versions often contain meat or insects.
