**Reconciliation-Ninzon Group Insurgency**
After nearly two centuries of colonialization alongside the growing Kaltoran population beginning to outnumber the Nephilim tensions quickly would grow. 

#### Phase 1 ()
[Political Figure 1] provided ideological inspiration for the Reconciliation movement. A large number of urban elites were also attracted to the ideology, which spread through Charu McNall's writings, particularly the [Historic Eight Documents]. These documents were essays formed from the opinions of many Reconciliation leaders.

On , the Clan Leader Sinai  declared their support for the movement initiated by [[Ninzon Santhal]], and their readiness to adopt armed struggle to redistribute land to the landless. The Clan Leader Cobalt who was then in power in the Eastern Emirates did not approve of an armed uprising. On []  in [[Ninzon Santhal]], [Rafan district], a sharecropper of Kaltoran background, who had been given land by the courts under the tenancy laws was attacked by the landlord's men. In retaliation, Kaltorans started forcefully capturing back their lands. When a police team arrived, they were ambushed by a group of Kaltorans led by Ninzon Santhal and a 6 police inspectors were killed in a hail of bullets. This event encouraged many Kaltorans and other low blood Nephilim to join the movement and to start attacking local landlords. Violent uprisings were organized in several parts of the territory by the **All Kaltoran Committee for Cooperation of Separation** [[AKCCS]]. 

On 22 April , the [[AKCCS]].  gave birth to the AKCCS Party. The party was formed by the radicals of the AKCCS like McNall and [[Ninzon Santhal]]. The first party congress was held in Breachport  where a Central Committee was elected. However, due to infighting the party soon split. In []  [[Ninzon Santhal]] revolted against the leadership and sectarianism of McNall. 

The result became that the party was split into two, one Provisional Central Committee for Active Seperation, NAS led by  [[Ninzon Santhal]].  Provisional Central Committee for Connection, NCC Party led by McNall. After McNall died in police custody, the party split into pro-and anti-McNall factions. 

The major Emirate Clans also retaliated by several operations notably [Operation Chase]. The main cadres of the Ninzonites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars. The movement fractured into more than 48 separate small groups. As a result, instead of popular armed struggle in the countryside, individual terrorism in Breachport and wider [[Emirate of Biyaha]] territories became a principal method of struggle.

#### Phase 2 ()
The early []  saw the spread of Ninzonizm to the majority of Northern Territories of Alawo, barring Eastern Emirates. 

By Ninzonist peasant revolts had spread to the [Mulch District] and [Abida District] These new waves of insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early [] insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked Northern White Gum Waste Villages along the [[Dahani Triumvirate]] and [[Marian United Republic]] borders.

The governments of [[Dahani Triumvirate]] and [[Marian United Republic]]  managed to quell down the rebels with a variety of counterinsurgency measures. After the death of a police sub-inspector in Breachport, officer [K. S. Vyas] raised a special task force called the Wan-Hounds. The [[Emirate of Biyaha]] established special laws that enabled police to capture and detain Ninzonist cadres, fighters and presumed supporters. They also invited additional paramilitary and [[Exillia]] forces. The states also set up rehabilitation programs like the Surrender and Rehabilitation Package and established new informant networks.

With the increased frictions on their borders with Mari and Dahani Elders and Officials began to step in in order to quell the rebellion. The Dahani stepped in on the side of the Emirates while the Mari joined on the side of the AKCCS-NAS believing their cause to be just in separation from their overlords.
