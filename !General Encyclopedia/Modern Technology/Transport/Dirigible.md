The upper compartment of a Dirigible is mostly nothing but normal air to allow for the [[Artifacts]] channeler to focus their energy into the artifact to the edges of the envelope while the craft flies. The square-cube law, which normally works _against_ engineers, actually benefits airships; a slight increase in overall size can lead to a massive increase in envelope volume and thus lifting capacity. In engineering terms, larger airships have a higher [payload fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_fraction) than smaller ones. The largest airships are likened to flying battleships or luxury liners, while the smallest ones (termed airboats) are little more than a channeler slung under a balloon with a minor power artifact.

Airships typically have what's known as a "channeler core."
This central engine compartment is often the most protected section of the craft as it keeps it in the air and even if attacked it is customary to not ever harm the channeler, for obvious reasons.
