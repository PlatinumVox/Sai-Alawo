The **lift cage** compartment of a Dirigible is mostly nothing but normal air to allow for the [[Artifacts]] channeler to focus their energy into the artifact to the edges of the envelope while the craft flies. The square-cube law, which normally works _against_ engineers, actually benefits airships; a slight increase in overall size can lead to a massive increase in envelope volume and thus lifting capacity. In engineering terms, larger airships have a higher [payload fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_fraction) than smaller ones. The largest airships are likened to flying battleships or luxury liners, while the smallest ones (termed dirigibles) are little more than a channeler slung under a balloon with a minor power artifact.

Airships typically have what's known as a "channeler core."
This central engine compartment is often the most protected section of the craft as it keeps it in the air and even if attacked it is customary to not ever harm the channeler, for obvious reasons.

**Safety at Air**
One of the most important safety systems on your dirigible is your set of navigation lights.

Whenever you are operating between sunset and sunrise, or in other times of restricted visibility, such as in fog or rain, you need to display the appropriate navigation lights so that other dirigibles can see you and take the appropriate action to avoid a collision.

In general, all navigation light systems include red and green sidelights, which indicate the port and starboard side of your dirigible, the fore (upper) and aft trailing light (lower) using blue and yellow respectively, as well as one or more white lights.

It's also important that you have a flashlight on board, as you never know when a navigation light might burn out. The rules for what navigation lights to display depend on a number of factors including:

-   The length of your dirigible: e.g. under or over 12 meters;
-   Whether your dirigible is being powered by a relic;
-   Where you're dirigibling, e.g. inland or international waters; and
-   Whether you at anchor.


**Military Classifications**
In the setting of Alawo the airships follow naming conventions similar to fortifications. Battleships are called Airfortresses because the first Airfortresses were just towable armored artillery guns that used lift cages to float in order to gain a better firing position.

Battleship -> Airfortress

Heavy Cruiser -> Airredoubt

Destroyer -> Aireduit

Frigates -> Airturrets
