A **rickshaw** originally denoted a two- or three-wheeled passenger cart, now known as a [pulled rickshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulled_rickshaw "Pulled rickshaw"), which is generally pulled by one person carrying one passenger.

Over time, [cycle rickshaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_rickshaw "Cycle rickshaw") (also known as pedicabs or trishaws), [auto rickshaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw "Auto rickshaw"), and [Biological Rickshaws] were invented, and have replaced the original pulled rickshaws, with a few exceptions for their use in tourism.

Pulled rickshaws created a popular form of transportation, and a source of employment for  strong bodied laborer's, within Sai-Alawoian cities. The majority are either manually peddled, electrically or sometimes pulled in rare cases. Rickshaw's are seen as taxi's of the Alawoian cities and are used by everyone from business people to common everyday workers for their highly affordable prices.
