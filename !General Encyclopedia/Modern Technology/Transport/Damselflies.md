The Dragon/Damselflies are believed to be some of the first organisms that ever flew. They have found fossilized Dragonflies, meganeuropsis permiana, with 2-foot wingspans. Their wing structure is unique in the animal kingdom and offers them incredible control of their movement while in the air. They hunt and consume their prey(mosquitos and other smaller flies) while in the air. They have a nymph stage that is fully aquatic and they are voracious predators while in this nymph form. Picture Damselflies can fold their four wings back when they are at rest (as seen in the background aircraft.) Dragonflies cannot fold their wings back and keep them jutting out to the sides like the aircraft in the foreground.
