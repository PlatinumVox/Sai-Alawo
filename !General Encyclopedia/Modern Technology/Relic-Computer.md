Concerns over the long-term repairability of micro-electronics along side the discovery of the efficency and powers of Dreamer/Ancient Relics  actually brought about a surge in relic computation with an influx of low-power or useless relics being collected.

A relic computer primarily will use a relic as its central processing unit. For storage Universal Reel to Reel Storage Units are used. These units are developed through the use of powderized relics applied to reels to both maximize surface area of relics and speed of access.

As a result of cassette based computing, any data must be hauled long distances through [[Dirigible]]s.

As a result of the distances between settlements being so vast, Universal Reel to Reel Storage Units of data must be physically hauled by individual Dirigibles. Most data hauling is done alongside other trade cargo, but on occasion mercenary teams will transport rare, expensive, or sensitive data as their sole cargo, or hide it in their cache.
