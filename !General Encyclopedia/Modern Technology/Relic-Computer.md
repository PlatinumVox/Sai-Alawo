Concerns over the long-term reparability of cathode-tube electronics along side the discovery of the efficiency and powers of Dreamer-Ancient Relics  actually brought about a surge in relic computation with an influx of low-power or useless relics being collected.

A relic computer primarily will use a relic as its central processing unit. For storage Universal Reel to Reel Storage Units are used. These units are developed through the use of powdered relics applied to reels to both maximize surface area of relics and speed of access.

The average machine has a fifty-foot long camshaft running the length of the machine that synchronized the machine's thousands of component parts and used 3,500 relic-relays for basic data processing on the level of the 2000s, before relics a computer of this size could only do basic math, now it can be on the level of the a modern desktop.
