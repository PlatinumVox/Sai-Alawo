##### The Unknown
**Lost Technologies**
The remnant technologies and wonders of humanity, the Ancients, and the J'van are spread across the galaxy. What technologies could be uncovered? What truths discovered? What power could have been wielded by them?
**Lost Races**
Several races have been detailed in this book, and others will be described in future books. The Ancients and J’van created thousands of species. Where and what are they?
**Aliens**
Does life exist that was not created by humanity, the Ancients, or
the J’van? And if it does, would we recognize it?
**Sentient AI**
As they were masters of electronic technologies and capable of creating the J'van, is it not reasonable to presume that humanity created other electronic children? But if they did, why did they not tell their beloved J'van? Are the Relicborne sentient?
**Ley Lines**
What is the true nature of the Ley Lines? Are they the result of a deliberate decision by humanity or an accident? Are there dimensions beyond ours? What other uses for Ley Energy exist?
