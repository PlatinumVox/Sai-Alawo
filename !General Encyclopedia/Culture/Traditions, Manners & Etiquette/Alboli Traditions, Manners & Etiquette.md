# Traditions
This is a short guide to assist the untrained eye on identifying the wide and beautiful variety of decorative painted patterns that Alboli are known to wear.

The base of the paint itself is mixed to have a smell that repels [[Frostmite]] along with other pests and supposedly wards off diseases. The smell can only be described to outsiders as unusual and fruit-like but most Alboli find it deeply comforting.

### Stories
Traditional storytelling and mythology play a large role in Alboli culture. For example, several legends center around the Aurora Cappealis. Some communities believe that their ancestors can be seen dancing in the lights, while others believe that the Aurora Cappealis will punish those who whistle at it. Gods such as the Old Woman are believed to live under the sea and ice in wait for them to fall in, welcoming them to the afterlife.

# Manners
### Lip Pointing
While gestures of the hand are often subject to customary variation across cultures, few can claim this phenomenon extends to contortions of the mouth. In Sivik, it is common to point with the lips instead of the thumb or index finger like the majority of the world. Wondering just how exactly a person points with their lips? It all starts by puckering up. Once an Alboli has their duck face on, they can direct their lips forward or side-to-side to indicate what it is they’d like to point out. The lip point is typically used in conversation to indicate something that is happening nearby.
# Etiquette
### Restaurants
In Sivik, while it’s still [generally considered polite] to allow those of a higher rank than you to go through a door first, that rule goes away when it comes time to enter a restaurant. By heading in first, the lower rank person of the group can be the one to talk to the host and get a table.

When greeting someone older or of a higher status than yourself, grip their right wrist with your left hand while shaking it; it’s a sign of respect and deference. Do ask questions about their health, family, clan etc. before getting to major topics, as skipping these niceties is seen as impolite. If sharing meals, do not begin eating until the eldest or highest of rank has been served and starts to eat.
