# Manners
### Your Job is not your Life
I don’t know about you, but I hate when I’m having dinner with someone and all they want to talk about is work.

No country agrees with that sentiment more than the [[Dahani Triumvirate]]. In Dahani, it’s socially unacceptable to prattle on about your job at social events, and people will likely let you know about it. Even if you’re having a business luncheon, it’s best to keep your conversation strictly unprofessional until the other party indicated they’re ready to talk turkey.

### Physical Touch
Touch has been used for healing purposes by different cultures for millennia. Many cultures today still understand the importance of touch and some cultures live skin-to-skin, starting early on by passing their babies from person to person, regardless of their age. Yet many cultures around the world have lost touch and wellbeing levels are suffering as a result, a major example of this is the Nephilim.

Within Nephilim culture it is common that a simple handshake is seen as enough physical contact in public settings. An average Nephilim may stand further away when talking, maintain less eye contact and usually steer clear of touch.

# Etiquette
### Dining Etiquette
If you are invited to a Nephilim’s house:

-   Arrive on time or no more than 15 minutes later than invited.
-   Take off your shoes. You may be given slippers to wear.
-   Dress well – smart casual, or business like is usually OK. Dressing well shows respect for your hosts.
-   Expect to be treated with honour, respect and generosity
-   Offer to help the host with preparation and clearing up after the meal. This may be turned down out of politeness, but a bit of light persistence is OK to get her to accept her offer.
-   The oldest or most honoured guest is served first
-   Do not begin eating until the host invites you to start –  Do not rest your elbows on the table.
-   Nephilim tend to put on an overwhelmingly generous spread, and you’ll often be urged to take second helpings
-   Use bread to soak up extra gravy or sauce
-   Nephilim pour drinks for those seated next to them
-   Leaving a small amount of food on your plate indicates that your hosts have provided amply. An empty plate signifies that you’re still hungry.
-   Do not get up until you are invited to leave the table. At formal dinners, the guest of honour is first to stand up
