Nephilim Reproduction
Nephilim are a little like slugs; they are all capable of producing both types of gametes simultaneously. They also recombine genes like crazy. A nephilim can have a single biological parent or over a dozenâ€”though too many parents is discouraged, because it creates nephilims that have to roam about too much to find unrelated partners when they grow up. It also means that inheritance can get pretty complicated.
