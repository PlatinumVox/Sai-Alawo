Though often regarded as an “unclean” and evil race by outsiders, Alboli are known to put heavy emphasis on staying clean and bathing regularly - more so than most current day humans

The primary reason behind this cultural obsession with cleanliness is that there is no greater shame than dying of an infection off of the battlefield.

Many outsiders who deal closely with Alboli have found that frontline medical care offered by Albolian physicians is unmatched in quality of care.

**Pride and Joy**
An Alboli's pride and joy is their eye care and hair, both of which require constant maintenance to look great and lower their risk of diseases. This extra attention given to their appearance makes them very appealing, even to other races; the infidelity of spouses who run off with their Alboli lovers has resulted in spurned partners spearheading a centuries-long smear campaign against Alboli.
