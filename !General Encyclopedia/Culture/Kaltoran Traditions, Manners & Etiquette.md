# Traditions
### Tradition of Hair Upkeep
Overview
Commonly fairer and wavier than the hair of humans. Long, well-maintained hair is paramount to any Kaltoran worth their salt. It is a deeply significant to their culture and represents things like: 
- Luck 
- Longevity 
- Commitment 
- Happiness

Cutting of Hair
Short hair is stigmatized and regarded as a rejection of traditional values, while light hair is believed to bring bad luck. Conversely, dark hair is a sign of good luck, but to snub your blessings and cut it is believed to invite divine retribution. Exiles, oath breakers and other undesirables are usually forced to cut of hair they've been caring for their whole lives. Any of these “undesirables ” are forced as punishment to remove the hair themselves in a public display of shame.

A common practice is to keep the hair of deceased loved ones and hair it close for remembrance and good luck.

##### Bonnets and Veils

Many Kaltorans spend their entire lives growing out and maintaining beautiful, long hair as a sign of status. It is a traditional for disgraced kaltorans to cut off their own hair, but murder, arson, torture, treason, and any other major crimes will lead to hair forcibly being cut off. Kaltoran hair is notoriously slow-growing, so this is a long term mark of damnation. Bonnets and veils are a common solution available to kaltorans wishing to repent for their crimes. They are believed to be an ugly necessity, as there is no greater shame than uncovered short hair. Many outsiders do not view these veils in the same manner and may mistake them for wedding apparel, much to the disdain of the veiled kaltorans in question. The headdress will match their hair color as closely as possible, and while all veils are generally frowned upon, black veils are seen as an omen of death. This is because it is believed that Kaltorans with black hair are luckier than average, but not by cutting it, they reject their blessings and bring retribution tenfold.

##### Stolen Valor

Kaltorans with a propensity for crime and being a disgrace may forgo the use of a veil or bonnet and instead sink their teeth deeper into a criminal underbelly. This is often perpetuated through the usage of an underground wig culture. Since for kaltorans value the length of their hair, criminal kaltorans may use wigs to hide their criminality. The usage of wigs if caught can be seen as an even harsher crime and is punished as such by authorities.

### Importance of Color 
A lot of Kaltoran color symbolism has been influenced by plays, with colors becoming associated with popular characters and later being used as a shorthand to invoke certain character archetypes to the audience. 

**Warm colors are generally "feminine"**, and cooler colors **"masculine"**
Red: Life, death, divinity, renewal; usually only worn by priests  
Blue: Doubt, rest  
Green: Wealth, maturity, trustworthiness  
Yellow: Fate, death, deceit, mourning 
Silver/gray:  Youth, strength, stubbornness  
Brown: Safety, control, knowledge  
Pink: Innovation, humor, mischief  
Orange: Intimacy, devotion, passion
Purple: Indulgence, foolishness, fun  
Black: Boldness, compassion, wisdom  
White: Peace, sleep, sickness

### Respect for the Dead
In Mari, the Kaltoran people take respect for dead ancestors to new levels with a ritual known as Famadihana. During Famadihana, people disinter dead relations from family crypts, and rewrap the bodies. Music and dancing ensue as participants parade the bodies around the tombs, and eventually return them to their resting places.

This observance makes the point that the dead are always with us and should never be forgotten, both literally and figurately .

# Manners
### Greetings
The typical Kaltoran greeting is a firm hug with a kiss on the cheek. A meeting between close friends often begins with a pat on the back and a hug.

### Kaltoran Naming Conventions

Kaltoran names are comprised of:
-   A first name, which is the given name
-   A middle name, which is a patronymic, or version, of the parent’s first name. It’s formed by adding ‘-avna’ or ‘-ovna’ to the end of a name. The son of Mikhail’s patronymic name would be Mikhailovna.
-   Last name, which is the family name or surname –  In formal situations, people are addressed by all three names. Friends and close acquaintances may refer to each other by the first name and patronymic.
-   Close friends and family members call each other by first name only.

# Etiquette
### Gift Giving Etiquette
-   If you are invited to a Kaltoran home for a meal, bring a small gift.
-    Older guests are usually expected to bring flowers. Don’t bring yellow flowers, as some Kaltorans see them as signifying separation or betrayal.
-   Do not give a baby a gift until after the baby is born. It’s bad luck to do so sooner.
-   Kaltorans often protest when they are offered a gift. Replying that “it’s just a little something” and offer the gift again and it will usually be graciously accepted.

### Importance of Alcohol
Turning down an alcoholic drink is considered terribly offensive in any Kaltoran home, so it’s a good idea to fortify yourself with some greasy food before heading out for a meal with a Kaltoran. Don’t smile at strangers or they’ll think you’re deranged, and when paying for items, place your money on the counter rather than trying to hand it directly to the cashier.

### Bartering is Life

The primary difference is that goods or services are exchanged immediately, and the exchange is reciprocal, meaning it’s a negotiated or fair trade, with each party getting the thing they want or need in an even amount to what they are offering in exchange.

When not receiving items from a local business, often through Rafanese Coinage, transactions are done through the use of various bartering methods.

Bartering allows individuals to get what they need with what they already own. If, for example, an individual needs lumber to put an addition onto their home but lacks funds to buy the lumber, then they may be able to use the barter system to supply their needs – for example, exchanging furniture they don’t need for the needed lumber.

Such a deal, of course, needs to be negotiated by both parties. It is a reciprocal, mutually-beneficial arrangement that doesn’t involve the exchange of cash or another monetary medium
