### Tradition of Hair Upkeep
Overview
Commonly fairer and wavier than the hair of humans. Long, well-maintained hair is paramount to any Kaltoran worth their salt. It is a deeply significant to their culture and represents things like: 
-Luck 
-Longevity 
-Commitment 
-Happiness

Cutting of Hair
Short hair is stigmatized and regarded as a rejection of traditional values, while light hair is believed to bring bad luck. Conversely, dark hair is a sign of good luck, but to snub your blessings and cut it is believed to invite divine retribution. Exiles, oath breakers and other undesirables are usually forced to cut of hair they've been caring for their whole lives. Any of these “undesirables ” are forced as punishment to remove the hair themselves in a public display of shame.

A common practice is to keep the hair of deceased loved ones and hair it close for remembrance and good luck.

##### Bonnets and Veils

Many Kaltorans spend their entire lives growing out and maintaining beautiful, long hair as a sign of status. It is a traditional for disgraced kaltorans to cut off their own hair, but murder, arson, torture, treason, and any other major crimes will lead to hair forcibly being cut off. Kaltoran hair is notoriously slow-growing, so this is a long term mark of damnation. Bonnets and veils are a common solution available to kaltorans wishing to repent for their crimes. They are believed to be an ugly necessity, as there is no greater shame than uncovered short hair. Many outsiders do not view these veils in the same manner and may mistake them for wedding apparel, much to the disdain of the veiled kaltorans in question. The headdress will match their hair color as closely as possible, and while all veils are generally frowned upon, black veils are seen as an omen of death. This is because it is believed that Kaltorans with black hair are luckier than average, but not by cutting it, they reject their blessings and bring retribution tenfold.

##### Stolen Valor

Kaltorans with a propensity for crime and being a disgrace may forgo the use of a veil or bonnet and instead sink their teeth deeper into a criminal underbelly. This is often perpetuated through the usage of an underground wig culture. Since for kaltorans value the length of their hair, criminal kaltorans may use wigs to hide their criminality. The usage of wigs if caught can be seen as an even harsher crime and is punished as such by authorities.
