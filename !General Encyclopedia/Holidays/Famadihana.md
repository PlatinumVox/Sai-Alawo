In Mari, the Kaltoran people take respect for dead ancestors to new levels with a ritual known as [[Famadihana]]. During [[Famadihana]], people disinter dead relations from family crypts, and rewrap the bodies. Music and dancing ensue as participants parade the bodies around the tombs, and eventually return them to their resting places.

This observance makes the point that the dead are always with us and should never be forgotten, both literally and figurately .
