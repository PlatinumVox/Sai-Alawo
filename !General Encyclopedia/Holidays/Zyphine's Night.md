**The Legend of Zyphine**
The Ancient (human) god Zyphine was quite mischievous. He complained to his mother Ihdione that he didn’t like his dark blue skin and wanted to be greyer, like the Nephilim mortal love of his life Comis.

Ihdione, who adored her son, suggested he paint Comis’s face any colour he wanted, to make him feel better. So that’s exactly what Zyphine did. Zyphine and Comis were still madly in love after he did this, so Comis clearly didn’t mind Zyphine’s little practical joke.

Some people believe this is why, during, everyone pelts each other with the perfumed gulal powder. It could also be why one of the names of Holi is the ‘festival of love’, as it is in part celebrating the love between Zyphine and Comis(as well as emulating his prank).

**Activities**
The festival consists primarily of dances and parties with colourful powders, which are held throughout the city of Andictoria. 

During this holiday, many are known to dye their clothes in colors of blue, antique gold, and coppery-orange. Many are also known to wear ceremonial, star-shaped masks. Cuisine commonly associated with the festival included barbecued beef meats as well as juices and alcoholic beverages of a pink color. The event is seen as a celebration of life, the ancients, and their gifts upon the Nephilim. 

In this celebration, those celebrating toss colourful Gulal powders at each other.

Gulal powder comes in many colours and some are thought to signify specific things:

-   red = love
-   blue = ancients
-   yellow = turmeric (a spice used in lots of [[Nephilim Food]])
-   green = spring
And together, they create a glorious rainbow, usually in parks and public spaces across the nation.
