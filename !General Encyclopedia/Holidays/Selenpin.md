Selenpin is chiefly celebrated after dark by the Alboli, when the stars were visible across the sky. Celebrants located stars associated with their own births, or with their ancestors. Those without a lucky star could purchase star maps from merchants to help divine which belonged to them, based on when and where they were born. Cloudy weather is considered especially favorable on Selenpin, as finding one's star on an overcast sky was viewed as a blessing from  Lady Luck. Selenpin was celebrated outside, with people trying to stay awake the entire night gathered around bonfires with plenty of music, food, and warm drinks.
