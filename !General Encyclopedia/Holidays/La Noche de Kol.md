La Noche de Kol or Night of the Kol, began when market sellers at the Zyphine market held every year in Andictoria's main square would carve Kol to attract buyers. [[Kol]] is a Kol-like fruit with an apple-like consistency. A major leader of the Triumvirate declared that there would be an official Kol-carving competition each year a day before [[Spring Masquerade]] and it became an annual tradition.

Entrants can either participate in the Free category, carving anything they like from the Kol, or the more popular Traditional category, which requires entries to reflect Ancient culture and current day Dahani festivals in some way. There are also two more categories for children to enter.

In order to ensure a fair competition, the government cultivates the Kol on a piece of land close to the city's [[Dirigible]]-port. Four days before the festival, the entrants head to the land to harvest their designated plot -- a plot number is assigned to them based on the order in which they signed up to the competition.

These Kol are not the small, bright pink Kol you might find at a supermarket. These are huge, deep purple Kol, some of which grow up to 80 centimeters long. They are planted over three months so that they vary in size to give the carvers more variety. Each year, some ten tons of Kol are harvested solely for the competition.

"I don't think they are edible," says Gojas, moving the large vegetable from palm to palm. Specially produced for the competition, these Kol are pumped full of fertilizer to make them grow big and would probably not be very kind on the stomach.

### Twas the week before Zyphine
With the competition taking place on the day before [[Spring Masquerade]] the entrants in this competion spend five days just before Spring enveloped in a world of Kol. One day for the harvest, one day for cleaning the Kol, two days to carve and the final day placing them on display as thousands of visitors file past through the day and night to see them.

Carving a perishable vegetable not only takes an artistic touch -- Gojas is a textile artist when he isn't carving Kol -- but it also holds another challenge: ensuring that the Kol do not wilt before the competition is judged.

Entrants have various techniques for keeping their Kol fresh, from placing moss on the figures to spraying them regularly with water. (Gojas also has another secret technique, developed over their four years of entering the competition -- but this one they're not prepared to share.)

The carving, therefore, takes skill, creativity, and judgment, deciding what to carve first, what to leave until last and then how to display it on the day. Competition is friendly but serious. Gojas has their eyes clearing focused on winning and with a prize of 30,000 [[Dhani Chips]], the incentive is big. However, it's clear that pride in being part of something so quintessentially celebratory of the Ancients and their people, seems to be a more powerful driving force than the prize money.

### Judgment day
The next morning, I go to the main square to find Gojas. Frazzled after the long night, their nerves are obvious. Gojas is concerned that their display space is smaller than last year, which means he has to rethink his presentation. However, later in the day as the sun is close to setting, I return and they are calmer, a happy tiredness setting in.

Huge lines of visitors are still waiting to see the displays that will be on show until midnight. Some entrants sit hidden behind their works of art, eating and chatting with family members, while others talk to visitors eager to know more about their creations. Carvings range from Ancient gods and scenes of intricate production to the three Triumvirate delivering gifts to the the Great Confessor ([[Dark Liithos Mysticism]]).
